        <h1>Learning Theories</h1>
        <h2 id="behaviourism">Behaviourism</h2>
        <p>According to a behaviourist, a display of correct behaviour shows that 
            one has learned. This behaviour must be observable, so therefore, cannot 
            depend on our mental processes such as reasoning and memory.
        </p>
        <p>One key behaviourist learning theory is Skinner's operant conditioning. This theory
            is based on the idea that we can change behaviour if we provide rewards or punishments
            after a behaviour. A lot of our learning is connected to our emotions, so reinforcements
            could be positive emotions such as happiness, pride, excitement, whereas punishments can be
            negative emotions we wish to suppress, like anger, sadness, or fear.
            In this sense, the sound of certain notes or chords could act like 
            a stimulus that causes reinforcement or punishment. In my experience, as a self-taught composer who has little 
            theoretical background on music, I depend a lot on experimentation to figure out the kind 
            of sound I am looking for. When certain chords or melodies sound bad, I am less likely to
            use those chords. These bad chords or melodies can be like a positive punishment, since 
            I will never want to use that chord progression or melody again. An example from my own work
            is the following accompaniment to a nice bassoon melody.

        <p>I personally think that the D# in the violas sounds a bit odd with the rest of the notes, even though it
            fits with the diminished 7th chord, and the notes do not flow into the next key of G major (the D in the first violin 
            clashes with the D# in the viola). Therefore, because this sounds bad, I will be less likely to produce music 
            that sounds like this to avoid having to hear this nonsense again. 
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, certain effects I think sound good tend to appear a lot in my pieces.
            For instance, the sound of the horns and the sound of the timpani sound surprisingly good
            on Musescore, my music writing software. The chills I get when I listen to 
            their sound is like a positive reinforcement that makes me more liekly to use them in my pieces. 
            Here are some excerpts of some of my compositions that feature these great sounds!

        <p>However, behaviourism cannot explain entirely how one learns to compose. Oftentimes, I am inspired
            by famous composers and the way they use certain instruments or chords to create textures and effects.
            This requires using knowledge to learn, which would go against behaviourist views that learning is 
            solely an observable act. And this is where we connect this to Cognitivism...
