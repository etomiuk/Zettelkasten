        <h2 id="expert">Expertise</h2>
        <p> Experts are people who can solve and think about problems in a certain domain efficiently (Lecture 5). There are three key features that experts 
            have in common.
            <ol>
                <li><b>Meaningful and organized knowledge:</b> experts possess a wide range of knowledge in their area of expertise (Lecture 5). Not only that, but they also are 
                    able to form deep connections between these topics. They can see patterns with information they learn which helps with coming up with stategies
                    to solve problems. Expert composers probably have a toolkit of different composition techniques that they have learnt. ** connection to deep processing
                </li>
                <li><b>Conditionalized knowledge:</b> experts know under which circumstances to use their knowledge (Lecture 5). This makes them more efficient because they don't 
                    need to search through their knowledge and apply all trategies they know. Perhaps expert composers will pick certain strategies when they want to 
                    convey a specific idea. They likely won't try to use a series of major chords to convey a feeling of depression!
                </li>
                <li><b>Automaticity:</b> experts become more automatic thinking about certain things, which leaves them room in their <a href="memory.html#wm">working memory</a> to deal with more
                    complex problems (Lecture 5). For instance, modern composers who use <a href="memory.html#ltm">notation software</a> to write music might become experts in that software so that they don't need to spend their
                    efforts trying to figure out how to add a piano pedal when they could be spending that time coming up with new ideas for a conclusion of their piece. This comes from lots 
                    of <a href="memory.html#ltm">repetition</a> and dedication to learning. Or perhaps a composer wants to change from one key to another. I know there are 
                    specific ways of modulating to a different key (that I do not know because I am not an expert), so an expert composer might know how to do so off the top of their head, 
                    while a novice like myself will have to try different chord combinations until I find one that sounds good to get the effect I want.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            Because experts have more this conditionalized knowledge that is well organized, they can be more creative in their problem solving. 
            They are able to form the unique connections between concepts so that they can solve novel problems in different ways. A novice 
            would have more trouble being creative because they lack the knowledge experts have build over time. For instance, it is hard to 
            be creative with an accompaniment line if it is already difficult to know what chords properly support the melody line (***revise this example).
        </p> 

        <p style="color:red;"> 
            A novice composer might experience a sort of functional fixedness in the sense that they use instruments in their 
            compositions for their "intentded" use. For example, using the double bass solely as an accompaniment instrument because that is 
            what is typically seen. An expert with more experience might see the double bass as a versatile instrument that can play more than 
            just an accompaniment line. They might add a complex lyrical passage for bass in a piece to give a deep and warm support to a melody, 
            which can be seen as really creative because that is rarely seen. 
        </p>
