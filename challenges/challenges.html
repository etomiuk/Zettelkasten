        <h1>Challenges in composition</h1>

            <p>
                Composition is hard. It is not easy to come up with <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">original ideas</a> and 
                stand out from the crowd. It is also hard to translate your ideas in coherent (and playable) music, especially when you 
                are a novice composer. This section outlines some challenges a novice might encounter as they try to compose as a way to 
                waise awareness of some limitations novices have as well as potential solutions.
            </p>

        <h2>What is an expert composer?</h2>

            <p> Experts are people who can solve and think about problems in a certain domain efficiently (Lecture 5). There are 
                three key features that experts have in common regardless of their domain of expertise.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Meaningful and organized knowledge:</b> Experts possess a wide range of knowledge in their area of 
                        expertise. Not only that, but they also are able to form deep connections between these topics. This means 
                        that they can connect seemlingly unrelated topics together or they relate the information to their life experiences. As 
                        mentioned <a href="../start/comp_strategies/memory.html">here</a>, these deeper connections help then better remember 
                        their knowledge and better and faster retrieval of that information from memory.
                        They can easliy see patterns with information they learn which helps with coming up with efficient stategies to solve problems.                    </li>

                    <li><b>Conditionalized knowledge:</b> Experts know when and where they use certain pieces of knowledge (also known as 
                        condition-action pairs). Conditionalized knowledge makes their problem solving more efficient because even through they
                        have a large amount of strategies they have remembered, they won't have to brute force try to apply all strategies to 
                        solve the problem.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Automaticity:</b> experts have the advantage that they seem to automatically know how to do certain things. This automaticity
                        allows them to focus their attention on more complex issues and leaves room in their working memory to work with the more important
                        information. This automaticity is reached because of their meaningful encoding of their expert knowledge.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                So based on these characteristics, how is someone considered an "expert" in composition? I am not an expert composer, but I 
                would imagine that their knowledge comes in form of music theory probably organized in some way in their mind. This knowledge 
                would allow them to fluently write certain parts of their melodies. For instance, based on the key of their melody and the key they 
                wish to modulate to, their knowledge on the circle of fifths and modulations would help them create this modulation effortlessly. In 
                comparison, I have no idea what is the strategy to modulate to a new key: I just do it based on instinct and what sounds good, but 
                the downside is that it sometimes takes me a long time to figure out a good way to do it. In this sense, expert composers might have a 
                set of composition strategies ready for them to use in specific contexts. For instance, a composer can write loud chords for stringed 
                instruments to get a loud ending of a piece, but this is not applicable to wind instruments who can only play one note at a time.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Presumably, if experts have taken all the time and effort to build up their knowledge base, they must of had some <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">
                intrinsic motivation</a> to pursue the domain of expertise. In turn, this intrinsic motivation makes learning new material 
                much easier, and learning new things will reinforce this motivation. In other words, experts keep on getting better and 
                better at their expert tasks because of a cycle of motivation and knowledge building that influence each other.
