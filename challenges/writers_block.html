        <h1>Writer's block</h1>

        <p> Writer's block is a huge struggle for anyone engaged in creative and artistic tasks. Lacking inspiration might put some 
            extraneous cognitive load because you need to now spend some effort thinking about creative ideas before even thinking about
            how to express these ideas in music. Not being able to begin writing music can lead to a decrease in 
            <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a> because you literally cannot begin or complete a given task. 
        </p>

        <h2>Stepping away from the problem</h2>
            <p>
                One way of helping writer's block is incubation (Lecture 12). Incubation is when you take time away from a problem and come
                back to it later (it can be a few hours, days, weeks, etc.). It might sound counterintuitive to stop doing a task in order to 
                help you continue this task, but this is a way to reset your cognitive load to 0. Taking time away allows you to "empty" your
                working memory from troubling thoughts or unnecessary knowledge that might prevent you from completing the task (so decresing 
                the extraneous load) so that later, you come back to the problem with a fresh mind with more room in your germain load to 
                solve the task. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This time away from the problem also in a way stops the deep processing of the information you're currently working with because 
                you are no longer focusing your attention on the task. 
                When you come back later to solve the problem, during the time away, your brain would have probably made more connections with
                the experiences you've lived in that time (perhaps unconsciously!) which can help you once you are ready to pay attention to the 
                problem. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The simplest form of incubation is sleep. There is evidence that shows that sleep or even awake quiescence can foster insight
                for a solution to a problem (Craig et al., 2018). Furthermore, Lewis et al. (2018) argue that the cycles of nREM and REM (REM 
                sleep is where dreams are more likely to occus) are times when the brain abstracts information from memories and creates 
                new connections between them, which is fuel for creative thoughts. Maybe that could explain why so many creative individuals 
                might get their ideas from their dreams!
            </p>
        
        <h2>Reach out to mentors</h2>
            <p>
                Another potential solution could be to reach out to a mentor who can provide help in generating ideas based on their 
                <a href="challenges.html">expertise</a>. In this process, you might learn how someone else might solve the current problem
                you're faced with which might help form deeper connections between concepts that you weren't able to make yourself, 
                as well as spark new creative ideas. After all, learning is very <a href="../experience/social.html">
                social</a>!
            </p>

            <p> 
                In composition this can also be done indirectly by going to listen to some of your favourite pieces. This can help learn
                how famous composers write certain passages that might be similar to what you are trying to write.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Getting inspiration from AI</h2>

            <p>
                As described <a href="../start/tech/AI.html">here</a>, there exist many AI-driven tools that can facilitate composition.
                Nowadays, we have access to ChatGPT to help us with literally any task. One advantage of AIs such as ChatGPT is that they
                can help us get started on an idea or a a problem we are stuck on by
                generating new ideas (Lecture 11). So can ChatGPT help composers when they are stuck in a writer's block?
                I conducted a few experiments to find out!
            </p>

            <p>
                This summer I was working on a composition I was really excited about, and I had come up with a really catchy melody
                for my piece:
            
                <video controls>
                    <source src="../videos/adventure_theme.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>

                However, I could not figure out how to transition to the next section of my piece, which was something
                a bit more lyrical. All 
                my initial ideas sounded bad and I was stuck in a writer's block for several days. I decided to try my chance at ChatGPT 
                to see if it could help me! Unfortunately I did not save the exact output it gave me at the time, but I tried as best I can 
                to recreate my prompt here:
                <img src="../imgs/chatgpt_adventure.png">
                <img src="../imgs/chatgpt_adventure2.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                The ideas that ChatGPT gives are actually quite bad. The first idea doesn't actually fit the time signature I gave It
                because it should have 6 eighth notes per measure, not eight. Then when it corrects itself, it just took a chunk of 6 notes
                from each line to make it fit my requirements. Then when I ask it to add some rhythm, it doesn't do a very good job
                since it only adds one rhythmic variance, which actually brings it back to a melody that can't fit in 6/8 time.

                This is what the second melody would have sounded like alongside my melody (note that I embellished it with a harmonization
                and an accompaniment myself): 

                <video controls>
                    <source src="../videos/adventure_theme_gpt.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </p>

            <p>
                So I thought that maybe ChatGPT needs to know what I wrote previously so it can build on it. This time it did a bit of a better job, 
                and it was able to even provide a reasoning for its melody: 
                <img src="../imgs/chatgpt_adventure3.png">
                <img src="../imgs/chatgpt_adventure4.png">


                It creates something a bit more interesting, but again lacks melody. But you can notice that it tries to use my original ideas
                as a starting point and build something from that to create some sort of interest, even though it is very short. It mimics 
                my melody contour as well as the length.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I combine both of its ideas together and add a harmony and accompaniment, I get something that sounds a bit better:
                <video controls>
                    <source src="../videos/adventure_theme_gpt2.mp4">
                </video>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the end, ChatGPT might not be the best AI tool to help you get out of a creative block because it is not specifically tailored
                to musical applications. However, it can help with other aspects of composition, as mentioned <a href="../start/tech/AI.html">here</a>.     
            </p>
