        <h1>Importance of supportive learning environment</h1>
        <p>
            Because learning is a very <a href="../experience/social.html">social</a> activity, other people can greatly influence one's self-efficacy 
            in a task. Someone who constantly gives positive reviews about your performance at a task and offers some constructive
            feedback can play a huge role in increasing someone's self-efficacy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A notable example of how self-efficacy and social expectations interact to deeply influences the pursuit of composition is with 19/20th century composer
            Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff finished writing his first symphony, and when the symphony was premiered
            for the first time, Rachmaninoff was not satisfied by its performance and how it sounded (Wikipedia). His piece also received a lot of brutal 
            feedback from critics, saying that "there is a lot of feeling ... but no sense whatever" (Glazunov, source) and that it "leaves an evil
            impression with its broken rhythms, obscurity and vagueness of form, meaningless repetition of the same short tricks" (Cui, source). 
            Rachmaninoff basically gave up on his composition career for a while after the premiere and fell into a 3-year depression where he was 
            unable to compose: "My confidence in myself had received a sudden blow. Agonizing hours spent in doubt 
            and hard thinking had brought me to the conclusion that I ought to give up composing" (Rachmaninoff, source). What a blow to one's 
            self-efficacy!
        </p>

        <p>
            Because composition can be a very personal activity (see identity section), it is important that the environment in 
            which one composes in will adequately help someone develop composition skills (I'm mostly referring to the social environment). 
            If a teacher constantly tells a student that their compositions suck, this might demotivate (see motivation) a student to 
            express themselves through music. They will no longer feel safe to share their compositions with their teacher for feedback, let
            alone sharing them with the world. Consequently, it may be a harder to develop composition skills (lecture 9): the student constantly feels the 
            extrinsic cognitive load of performance pressure and pleasing their teacher rather than composing for the primary reason why they chose to compose, 
            which was to express themselves... (see a future section on cognitive load). They might even feel like they have little choice in what they learn because they 
            are producing work for someone else (see choice and motivation).
