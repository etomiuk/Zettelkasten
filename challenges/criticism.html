        <h1>Criticizing your work</h1>
        
        <p>
            Criticism is something all composers must face when they write music. There will always be someone who will not be a 
            fan of your work. That person can be yourself! This section outlines how criticism from ourselves and others can impact 
            our journey as composers, and how to potentially be less negatively affected by it.  
        </p>

    <h2>Being too critical of your work</h2>
        <p>
            In the context of composition, even though there exist those composition prodigies who are able to write entire
            symphonies at 4 years old, don't let that discourage you to write music. If you believe that you can acquire
            the skills necessary to compose good music (i.e. you have a <a href="../motivation/increase.html">growth mindset</a>), 
            then go for it! Of course, it helps to put in the effort to get some
            background knowledge about music and <a href="../start/comp_strategies.html">composition techniques</a>,
            and perhaps a good <a href="../experience/social/modelling.html">mentor</a> who can guide you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think composers, like most artists, are extremely critical about their personal work. This might be because
            their compositions are often very deeply tied into their personal lives, so they express very intimate personal emotions, feelings,
            or life events, but at the same time, to make a living, they need to be able to satisfy their audience's needs and demands.
            In order to <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> themselves, to continue writing music, they need to be able
            to be confident in their abilities to express their ideas, which is easier said than done...
        </p>

        <p>
            Increasing <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a> is not always trivial expecially if you are a novice 
            composer who doesn't possess the prior knowledge or the musical abilities to generate the compositions you have imagined.
            Often, I will start
            off with an idea, but it sounds horrible, so I am not <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivated</a> to continue
            my piece because I don't believe I have the ability to fix it and make it sound better. I even have a folder on my laptop
            that contains all of my unfinished/abandoned pieces (I have almost 100 of them...)!
        </p>

        <h3>Dunning-Kruger effect</h3>

            <p>
                A potential reason for this sort of disappointement one might get when listening to the work they have just produced 
                can also be attributed to the Dunning-Kruger effect. 
                The Dunning-Kruger effect states that novices will overestimate their abilities to accomplish the task, while 
                <a href="./challenges.html">experts</a> will underestimate them (lecture 6). 
            </p>

            <p>
                This makes sense: a novice doesn't have the knowledge yet to complete a task, 
                so they don't have a good grasp on what is difficult or how complex a task can be if well done because of their lack 
                of experience with the subject as well as lack of prior knowledge. 
                A novice composer might think that composing a piece is quite easy: it's just putting a 
                bunch of notes together and maybe adding some kind of accompaniment and harmonization! But experts know it is much more than 
                that.
            </p>
            <p> When I was 15, I definitely thought my first compositions were really neat! Looking back at them now, I 
                cringe and wonder how I ever thought that some of the things I wrote were good ideas. Therefore, a novice might think 
                that they have written something good, but then when they listen to their composition, be it a few minutes later or 
                a few years later, they might be disappointed in the result because they had high expectations. This disappointment, 
                especially if it is immediate (Lecture 3), is like a positive punishment that might decrease one's self-efficacy because they 
                no longer feel confident in their composition abilities, which might demotivate someone to compose. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the other hand, 
                <a href="./challenges.html">experts</a> do have knowledge in their domain of expertise: they know exactly what is considered to be a difficult problem in their field (Lecture 6).
                Therefore, they might tend to think that they do not possess the tools necesary to solve the problem just yet (or else it wouldn't be 
                that difficult). Expert composers are aware of the level of detail needed
                to make a song sound like they imagined. They take the extra care to select the right instruments, rhythms, dynamics to 
                express their idea, and yet, might think their piece still doesn't sound good enough. 
            </p>
            <p>Now that I have gotten a lot more (self-taught)
                experience in composition and music in general, I feel that I am much more critical 
                with my pieces. Even though I am not an expert yet, when I have an idea, I find it difficult to translate that idea exactly how I 
                imagined it because I want to be careful in chosing how I need to write this idea on paper. Many of the great composers unfortunately 
                suffered from this effect: many famous classical works are actually unfinished and this might be due to lack of <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a>
                from these composers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once a novice has built their knowledge and has transitioned from overestimating to underestimating their abilities, 
                I think that this is a sign that that novice has <a href="../learning/learning.html">learned</a>!
            </p>

    <h2>Importance of supportive learning environment</h2>
        <p>
            Because learning is a very <a href="../experience/social.html">social</a> activity, other people can greatly
            influence one's self-efficacy in a task. Someone who constantly gives positive reviews about your performance at
            a task and offers some constructive feedback can play a huge role in increasing someone's <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a>. On the 
            other hand, it might not be motivating to have people always saying that your work sucks.
        </p>

        <p>
            A notable example of how self-efficacy and social expectations interact to deeply influences the pursuit of composition is with 19/20th century composer
            Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff finished writing his first symphony, and when the symphony was premiered
            for the first time, Rachmaninoff was not satisfied by its performance and how it sounded (Wikipedia). His piece also received a lot of brutal 
            feedback from critics, saying that "there is a lot of feeling ... but no sense whatever" and that it "leaves an evil
            impression with its broken rhythms, obscurity and vagueness of form, meaningless repetition of the same short tricks". 
            Rachmaninoff basically gave up on his composition career for a while after the premiere and fell into a 3-year depression where he was 
            unable to compose: "My confidence in myself had received a sudden blow. Agonizing hours spent in doubt 
            and hard thinking had brought me to the conclusion that I ought to give up composing" (Rachmaninoff, source). What a blow to one's 
            self-efficacy!
        </p>

        <p>
            Because composition can be a very personal activity, it is important that the environment in 
            which one composes in will adequately help someone develop composition skills.
            <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">Extrinsic motivators</a>, such as approval, often need to be sustained in order to be 
            effective at getting someone to learn and perform a new task.
            If a teacher constantly tells a student that their compositions suck, this might demotivate a student to 
            express themselves through music. They will no longer feel safe to share their compositions with their teacher for feedback, let
            alone sharing them with the world since the teacher's feedback acts as a positive punishment. Consequently, it may be a harder to develop composition skills (lecture 9): the student constantly feels the 
            extrinsic cognitive load of performance pressure and pleasing their teacher rather than composing for the primary reason why they chose to compose, 
            which was to express themselves.... They might even feel like they have little <a href="./choices.html">choice</a> in what they learn because they 
            are producing work for someone else.
