        <h1>Being too critical of your work</h1>
                <p>
                    In the context of composition, even though there exist those composition prodigies who are able to write entire
                    symphonies at 4 years old, don't let that discourage you about writing music. If you believe that you can acquire
                    the skills necessary to compose good music (i.e. you have a <a href="../motivation/increase.html">growth mindset</a>), 
                    then go for it! Of course, it helps to put in the effort to get some
                    background knowledge about music and <a href="../comp_strategies/comp_strategies.html">composition techniques</a>,
                    and perhaps a good <a href="../experience/social.html">mentor</a> who can guide you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think composers, like most artists, are extremely critical about their personal work. This might be because
                    their compositions are often very deeply tied into their personal lifes, so they express very intimate personal emotions, feelings,
                    or life events, but at the same time, to make a living, they need to be able to satisfy their audience's needs and demands.
                    In order to <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> themselves, to continue writing music, they need to be able
                    to be confident in their abilities to express their ideas, which is easier said than done...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Increasing <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a> is not always trivial expecially if you are a novice 
                    composer who doesn't possess the prior knowledge or the musical abilities to generate the compositions you have imagined.
                    Often, I will start
                    off with an idea, but it sounds horrible, so I am not <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivated</a> to continue
                    my piece because I don't believe I have the ability to fix it and make it sound better. I even have a folder on my laptop
                    that contains all of my unfinished/abandoned pieces (I have almost 100 of them...)!
                </p>

            <h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2>

                <p>
                    A potential reason for this sort of disappointement one might get when listening to the work they have just produced 
                    can also be attributed to the Dunning-Kruger effect. 
                    The Dunning-Kruger effect states that novices will overestimate their abilities to accomplish the task, while 
                    <a href="./challenges.html">experts</a> will underestimate them (lecture 6). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This makes sense: a novice doesn't have the knowledge yet to complete a task, 
                    so they don't have a good grasp on what is difficult or how complex a task can be if well done because of their lack 
                    of experience with the subject as well as lack of prior knowledge. 
                    A novice composer might think that composing a piece is quite easy: it's just putting a 
                    bunch of notes together and maybe adding some kind of accompaniment and harmonization! But experts know it is much more than 
                    that. When I was 15, I definitely thought my first compositions were really neat! Looking back at them now, I 
                    cringe and wonder how I ever thought that some of the things I wrote were good ideas. Therefore, a novice might think 
                    that they have written something good, but then when they listen to their composition, be it a few minutes later or 
                    a few years later, they might be disappointed in the result because they had high expectations. This disappointment, 
                    especially if it is immediate (Lecture 3), is like a positive punishment that might decrease one's self-efficacy because they 
                    no longer feel confident in their composition abilities, which might demotivate someone to compose. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    On the other hand, 
                    experts do have knowledge in their domain of expertise: they know exactly what is considered to be a difficult problem in their field (Lecture 6).
                    Therefore, thye might tend to think that they do not possess the tools necesary to solve the problem just yet (or else it wouldn't be 
                    that difficult). Expert composers are aware of the level of detail needed
                    to make a song sound like they imagined. They take the extra care to select the right instruments, rhythms, dynamics to 
                    express their idea, and yet, might think their piece still doesn't sound good enough. Now that I have gotten a lot more (self-taught)
                    experience in composition and music in general, I feel that I am much more critical 
                    with my pieces. Even though I am not an expert yet, when I have an idea, I find it difficult to translate that idea exactly how I 
                    imagined it because I want to be careful in chosing how I need to write this idea on paper. Many of the great composers unfortunately 
                    suffered from this effect: many famous classical works are actually unfinished and this might be due to lack of <a href="../motivation/increase.html">self-efficacy</a>
                    from these composers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once a novice has built their knowledge and has transitioned from overestimating to underestimating their abilities, 
                    I think that this is a sign that that novice has <a href="../learning/learning.html">learned</a>!
                </p>
