        <h1>Lack of creativity</h1>

        <p> 
            Building off of the idea that someone lacks ideas, it is possible that someone who knows a bit of music and how instruments works does 
            have an idea, but when they go and compose and perform their piece, it does not sound great. Thus, we might not consider such an individual to be
            an expert composer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Because <a href="./challenges.html">experts</a> have more this prior 
            well-organized knowledge, the extra room left in their working memory can be dedicated to <i>creative</i> problem solving.
            This is why the deep processing and the connections between information and experiences is so important in expertise (Lecture 5). After all, 
            two of the three requirements of creativity are prior knowledge and domain specific knowledge (the third being motivation), which experts already have.
            They are able to form the unique connections between concepts so that they can solve novel problems in different ways. A novice 
            might have more trouble being creative because they lack the knowledge experts have built.
        </p> 

        <h2>Functional fixedness: getting stuck with an idea</h2>
        <p> 
            A novice composer might be well aware of all this, but still might experience what we call "functional fixedness". This is when 
            someone is stuck using something only for its intended use, or the use that was taught by someone else. For instance, a composer
            might always use a double bass as an accompaniment or background instrument because of its low register and that is what it typically seen in most pieces. 
            Functional fixedness can be due to a mentor teaching someone how to perform a certain task and the student internalizing this as the 
            only way to accomplish a task. This is often seen if the teacher uses <a href="../experience/social.html">directed learning</a> as a 
            teaching strategy because this strategy requires teachers to inform students without the need for students to actively work with the material 
            themselves and questioning it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, functional fixedness could also be due to, again, this lack of knowledge from the novice, since 
            if they don't know other ways of completing a task, or any additional knowledge that can allow them to think of alternatve ways of solving a 
            problem, then they can't really be expected to know how to solve the problem in any other perhaps more creative ways.  
            An expert with more experience might see the double bass as a versatile instrument that can play more than 
            just an accompaniment line, perhaps because they are aware of the nice and warm sound a bass can produce. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of the <a href="../start/comp_strategies.html">composition strategies</a> can help a novice get out of this functional fixedness
            stage by providing ideas and knowledge on how a composition can be made a bit more creative and outside the box.
