        <h1>Limiting choices</h1>
        <p>
            Having choices can increase our motivation to execute a task (Lecture 7). This is because we can choose to
            make this task more meaningful to ourselves, and a task that is more meaningful will motivate us more to complete it. 
            Limiting creativity might negatively impact a composer's work because it doesn't 
            allow them to use all the "tools" and techniques they want to express their ideas. For instance, during the pandemic, my high school
            would split music classes in small groups to not have too many students in the same room. 
            One of her classes only had 3 students so they could not play a piece meant for band, so she asked me to compose a short piece
            for these three students who played trumpet, trombone, and electric bass.
            My creativity while writing this piece was limited in several ways:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Extrinsic motivation:</b> My motivation was <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic</a>. I wanted to please my teacher and write something
                    that she would approve of as well as something that I thought the students would enjoy playing. I was not necessarily writing
                    something for myself because I did not willingly chose to write this piece. This means that the final result might not be as good
                    compare to if I were intrinsically motivated.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Fixed instruments:</b> I had a fixed set of instruments to work with. This means I also have a limited set of sounds I can use as well. 
                    I was challenged with how to include an electric bass with two brass instruments. I would have naturally never picked 
                    to include an electric bass with two brass instruments, especially since I already was using a bass instrument.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Musican skills:</b> I had to consider the musical capacities of the students: they were high school students with little musical training
                    apart from what they learn in class. That meant that I was limited in the complexity of the music I wrote and even the notes
                    that I use (for instance, high notes are hard to reach on brass instruments so it's better not to write a lot of them). 
                    The piece needed to also be short or else the students get tired and lose their attention.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although I was motivated to write this piece because it presented some new challenges, the lack of choices made it 
                difficult to write and it was hard to find inspiration to write a piece with all these constraints because I had many other 
                ideas that I could not use in this particular piece. Therefore, when composing, it is best to keep all options open so that 
                you can can control the way you write the piece, which will keep your motivation high.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2>Having too many choices</h2>

            <p>
                On the other hand, having too many choices can be harmful, especially if you're not an expert, because you don't have the
                necessary knowledge to know what composition techniques to use or what instruments to use (Lecture 7). A beginner composer
                would likely feel overwhelmed if they wanted to write an entire 40 minute symphony for 20 instruments. 
                This abundance of choice can actually increase the extrinsic load of the task because 
                you don't know where and how to start writing for such a large ensemble (in other words, you might have <a href='writers_block.html'>writer's block</a>)
                which might leave you with decision paralysis. Therefore, it might be best for novices to start with simple compositions, something 
                that is challenging, but is also comfortable considering their current knowledge and experience. Then they can work their way up from 
                there.
            </p>

        <h2>Picking the "right" challenge</h2>
            <p>
                So this might sound simple enough, but why is picking the right amount of challenge important? This idea is based on the 
                Zone of Proximal Development, which is an an application of <a href="../learning/constructivism.html">constructivist</a>
                theories (Lecture 6). This zone is where the ideal difficulty of a task lies. It is where the ideal amount of learning 
                happens because the task won't be too easy nor too difficult. You don't want to add unnecessary extraneous cognitive load
                to a task that might already be difficult!
                
            <p>
                What this zone looks like will be different for everyone 
                depending on their current knowledge, their experiences, and the amount of support they have in the task. This 
                zone will also change as you become better at a task because things that were once challenging will become easier
                with more practice. Therefore, one should keep in mind that their goals should probably change as they are trying to 
                perform a task such as composition as they figure out what is working for them, and what is working less well. For instance, 
                if you start off trying to compose a piece for orchestra knowing nothing about how an orchestra works, you might realize
                that it is very hard to get something that sounds good. Therefore, this challenge is not quite in your zone of proximal development, 
                and you can perhaps change your composition goal to be something like "write a composition for piano", because maybe that's an 
                instrument you know how to play. This changing of goals makes one a better learner (Lecture 7). 
            </p>

            <p>
                So how do we know what is our zone of proximal development? According to this theory, the things you learn in this zone are things 
                you can learn well if you are well supported. This is why it is important to have a good <a href="../experience/social/modelling.html">
                mentor</a>, or even a good point of reference (such as a book or website as reference) so that you can refer to something 
                when you're stuck. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than that, it might just be by trial and error and self-regulation. Self-regulated learning is the idea that you can 
                control your learning by paying attention to your progress in a task and reevaluating your learning goals (Lecture 6). In this sense, 
                it is very metacognitive. Self-regulation has three main phases: forethought, where you set your goals, performance, where you 
                attempt to accomplish your goals, and self-reflection, where you reflect on how well you attained the goal. Therefore, in the 
                context of composition, you might just have to try setting a particular goal, trying to achieve it, and see if you need to change 
                it to make it better fit into your zone of proximal development.
