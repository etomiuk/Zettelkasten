        <p>
            Having choices can increase our motivation to execute a task (Lecture 8). This is because we are allowed to have the option to
            make this task more meaningful to ourselves. Limiting creativity might negatively impact a composer's work because it doesn't 
            allow them to use all the "tools" and techniques they want to express their ideas. For instance, during the pandemic, my high school
            would split music classes in small groups to not have too many students (who are all playing wind instruments) in the same room. 
            It ended up such that one of her classes only contained 3 students so they could not play a piece meant for band, so my music 
            teacher asked me to compose a short piece for these three students who played trumpet, trombone, and electric bass.
            My creativity while writing this piece was limited in several ways:

            <ul>
                <li>My motivation was <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic</a>. I wanted to please my teacher and write something
                    that she would approve of as well as something that I thought the students would enjoy playing. I was not writing something for myself.
                </li>

                <li>I had a fixed set of instruments to work with. This means I also have a limited set of sounds I can use as well. 
                    I was challenged with how to include an electric bass with two brass instruments. I would have naturally never picked 
                    to include an electric bass with two brass instruments, one of them already being a lower register instrument.
                </li>

                <li>I had to consider the musical capacities of the students: they were high school students with little musical training
                    other from what they learn in class. That meant that I was limited in the complexity of the music I wrote and even the notes
                    that I use (for instance, high notes are hard to reach on brass instruments so it's better not to write a lot of them). 
                    The piece needed to also be short or else the students get tired and lose their attention.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Although I was motivated to write this piece because it presented some new challenges, the lack of choices made it 
            difficult to write and it was hard to find inspiration to write a piece with all these constraints because I had many other 
            ideas that I could not use in this particular piece.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, having too many choices can be harmful, especially if you're not an expert, because you don't have the
            necessary knowledge to know what composition techniques to use or what instruments to use (Lecture xxx). A beginner composer
            would likely feel overwhelmed if they had to write an entire 40 minute symphony for 20 instruments because of all the instruments
            they can chose to write for! This abundance of choice can actually increase the extrinsic load of the task because 
            you don't know where and how to start and you might have this sort of decision paralysis. As mentioned <a href="">here</a>
            it might be best for novices to start simple and then work their way up to larger scale pieces.
