        <h1>Talent and self-efficacy in composition</h1>
            <p>
                Can composition even be learned? Or are people just naturally be good at it? Well, of course it can e learned, 
                or else this website would be useless! But many cognitive factors can influence how well you learn something.
            </p>

            <h2>Building growth mindset and self-efficacy</h2>

            <p>***note to self: reread this to see if coherent</p>
            <p>
                The idea that your intelligence and abilities are innate and therefore cannot be changed is called a growth mindset (lecture 7?). 
                Someone with a growth mindset is more likely ot attribute their failures to some kind of fault in their abilities. Such people
                will have more trouble bouncing back from setbacks and will strive to always perform well and be smart. If you think that 
                it is impossible to become more creative because lack of creativity is something you are born with, then it will be hard to motivate
                 yourself write creatively (link to motivation). It is better to adopt
                a growth mindset when learning, because this mindset promotes a mastery approach to learning where your successes can be attributed
                to the effort you put in a task rather than your innate intelligence. Those with a growth mindset will believe that their intelligence
                and abilities can be changed with effort and hard work. This will help increase your self-efficacy in a task.
            </p>

            <p>
                Self-efficacy relates to how well you think you can accomplish a task (Lecture 6). Other people can help us increase our self-efficacy by providing 
                <a href="./modelling.html">mentorship</a> during our learning. One's self-efficacy affects one's behaviour and attitude towards a task (Lecture 6).
                Those with high self-efficacy will be more likely to accomplish the task because they are confident in their ability to finish it, and they will 
                work through the challenges that are there. They are also more likely to set harder goals and challenge themselves (Leture 6).
            </p>

            <p>If someone has low self-efficacy, they will be less likely to complete a task because they are not good at it. In a way, it adds
                extraneous cognitive load (connect with CG section if one will be created) because you are constantly being critical of your own work and pressured to write something that
                sounds amazing which can prevent you from just writing for fun or for the sake of composing. 
                Sadly, this happens to me all the time. Often, I will start off with an idea, but it sounds horrible, so I am 
                not motivated to continue my piece (look at how many abandonned pieces I have *insert pic of these pieces*).
            </p>

            
            <p>
                In the context of composition, even though there exists those composition prodigies who are able to write entire
                symphonies at 4 years old, don't let that discounrage you about writing music. If you believe that you can acquire
                the skills necessary to compose good music, then go for it! Of course, it helps to put in the effort to get some
                background knowledge about music and composition techniques, and perhaps a good mentor that can guide you.
            </p>

            <h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2>
            <p> Mention that skilled composers are extremely critical of their own work, while novice composers think their beginner stuff
                is super good. I experienced that myself *put example of horrible beginner piece --> or refer back to home page example*. 
            </p>

            <h2>Importance of supportive learning environment</h2>
            <p>
                Because learning is a very social activity (connect to social), other people can greatly influence one's self-efficacy 
                in a task. Someone who constantly gives positive reviews about your performance at a task and offers some constructive
                feedback can play a huge role in increasing someone's self-efficacy. 
            </p>
            
            <p>A notable example of how self-efficacy deeply influences the pursuit of composition is with 19/20th century composer
                Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff finished writing his first Symphony, in which he had high hopes in. When the symphony was premiered
                for the first time, Rachmaninoff was not satisfied by its performance and how it sounded. His piece also received a lot of brutal 
                feedback from critics, saying that "there is a lot of feeling ... but no sense whatever" (Glazunov, source) and that it "leaves an evil
                 impression with its broken rhythms, obscurity and vagueness of form, meaningless repetition of the same short tricks" (Cui, source). 
                 Rachmaninoff basically gave up on his composition career for a while after the premiere and fell into a 3-year depression where he was 
                 unable to compose: "My confidence in myself had received a sudden blow. Agonizing hours spent in doubt 
                 and hard thinking had brought me to the conclusion that I ought to give up composing" (Rachmaninoff, source). Very dramatic...
            </p>

            <p>
                Because composition can be a very personal activity (see identity section), it is important that the environment in 
                which one composes in will adequately help someone develop composition skills (I'm mostly referring to the social environment). 
                If a teacher constantly tells a student that their compositions suck, this might demotivate (see motivation) a student to 
                express themselves through music. They will no longer feel safe to share their compositions with their teacher for feedback, let
                alone sharing them with the world. Consequently, it may be a harder to develop composition skills (lecture 9): the student constantly feels the 
                extrinsic cognitive load of performance pressure and pleasing their teacher rather than composing for the primary reason why they chose to compose, 
                which was to express themselves... (see a future section on cognitive load). They might even feel like they have little choice in what they learn because they 
                are producing work for someone else (see choice and motivation).
