        <h1>Talent and self-efficacy in composition</h1>
            <p>
                Can composition even be learned? Or are people just naturally be good at it? Well, of course it can be learned, 
                or else this website would be useless! But many cognitive factors can influence how well you learn something.
            </p>

            <h2>Building growth mindset and self-efficacy</h2>

                <p>
                    The idea that your intelligence and abilities are innate and therefore cannot be changed is called a growth mindset
                    (lecture 7). Someone with a growth mindset is more likely ot attribute their failures to some kind of fault in their
                    abilities. Such people will have more trouble bouncing back from setbacks because they don't they don't think they
                    can do anything to change their performance.
                    If you think that it is impossible to become more <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creative</a> because you
                    believe that creativity is something you are born with, then it will be hard to <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> 
                    yourself compose creatively. Therefore, it is better to adopt a growth mindset when learning, because this mindset
                    promotes a mastery approach to learning where your successes can be attributed to the effort you put in a task rather
                    than your innate intelligence. Those with a growth mindset will believe that their intelligence and abilities can be
                    changed with effort and hard work. This will help increase your self-efficacy in a task.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Self-efficacy relates to how well you think you can accomplish a task (Lecture 6). One's self-efficacy affects
                    one's behaviour and attitude towards a task. Those with high self-efficacy will be more likely to accomplish a 
                    difficult task because they are confident in their ability to finish it, and they will work through the obstacles
                    they encounter. They are also more likely to set harder <a href="../motivation/goals.html">goals</a> and challenge
                    themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, if someone has low self-efficacy, they will be less likely to complete a task because they 
                    don't believe that they can accomplish it for whatever reason. In a way, low self-efficacy adds extraneous cognitive load (connect with CG section if one will be created)
                    in addition to the intrinsic cognitive load due to the inherent difficulty of the task, which leaves little
                    room for germaine load that would be used to organize our ideas and leave room for <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think composers, like most artists, are extremely critical about their work. They need to be able to be confident
                    in their abilities to express their ideas to be able to <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> themselves
                    to continue writing music. 
                    Sadly, I often have low self-efficacy when it comes to composing. Often, I will start off with an idea, but it
                    sounds horrible, so I am not <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivated</a> to continue my piece because 
                    I don't believe I have the ability to fix it and make it sound better. Look at how many pieces are in my
                    unfinished/abandoned folder!
                </p>

                <img class="piano-imgs" src="../imgs/unfinished.png">

                <p>
                    This also might be due to the fact that I am not an <a href="../experience/social.html">expert</a> composer. There is a lot of things I do not know about
                    composition (music theory for instance) which could be why I struggle finding solutions to my problems. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In the context of composition, even though there exist those composition prodigies who are able to write entire
                    symphonies at 4 years old, don't let that discourage you about writing music. If you believe that you can acquire
                    the skills necessary to compose good music, then go for it! Of course, it helps to put in the effort to get some
                    background knowledge about music and <a href="../comp_strategies/comp_strategies.html">composition techniques</a>,
                    and perhaps a good <a href="../experience/social.html">mentor</a> can guide you.
                </p>

            <h2>Dunning-Kruger effect</h2>

                <p>*** pretty repetitive with the personal example given above...</p>
                <p>
                    The Dunning-Kruger effect states that novices will overestimate their abilities to accomplish the task, while experts
                    will underestimate their competence (lecture ?). This makes sense: a novice doesn't have the knowledge yet to complete a task, 
                    so they don't have a good grasp on what is difficult or how complex a task can be if well done. On the other hand, 
                    experts do have this knowledge: they know exactly what is difficult in their domain and might tend to believe that these 
                    problems are hard to solve. Similarly, a novice composer might think that composing a piece is quite easy: it's just putting a 
                    bunch of notes together! When I was 15, I definitely thought my first compositions were really neat! Looking back at them now, I 
                    cringe and wonder how I ever thought I wrote was a good idea. However, expert composers are aware of the level of detail needed
                    to make a song sound like they imagined. They take the extra care to select the right instruments, rhythms, dynamics to 
                    express their idea, and yet, might think their piece still doesn't sound good enough. Now, I feel that I am much more critical 
                    with my pieces. Not that I am an expert yet, but when I have an idea, I find it difficult to translate that idea exactly how I imagined 
                    it. Perhaps this change in mindset has demonstrated that you are <a href="../learning/learning.html">learning</a>!
