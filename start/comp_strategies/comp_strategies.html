        <h1>Composition strategies</h1>
        
            <p>
                We often learn about methods of composing from the great classical composers. They serve as <a href="../../experience/social/modelling.html">
                models</a> for us to get inspiration from. Many of them, such as Rameau (2019), Rimsky-Korsakov (1964), or Schoenberg (1973), have written
                treatises that give background theory and knowledge about how to compose. These sources of knowledge become part of a certain composition
                culture that gets transmitted throughout many generations that result in this new behaviour, that is, a way in which composers write their music (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). Thus, they define western traditions in composition.
                If you learn how to compose by being inspired by such resources, it is always good to remember where these sources are coming from and how
                they might influence your composition style. 
            </p>

            <h2>Why creativity?</h2>
                <p>
                    However, we don't simply want to copy the great composers. As composers, we try to create something unique and creative, something 
                    that has never been heard before. As mentioned <a href="../../motivation/creativity.html">here</a>, this is often one of the 
                    goals a composer has when writing music. Creativity is often what makes a composer "better" and well-known. They need to be innovative.
                    If one person writes the exact kinds of pieces as Bach, what would be the motivation that pushes us to listen to this new guy over
                    listening to Bach, someone whom we KNOW has good music.
                </p>


            <h2>What makes a composition creative?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think that it is quite difficult to pinpoint what is a creative composition - there are so many aspects that make a composition creative.
                    It is possible that everyone has a different definition of creative, especially since creativity and personal tastes can be related. 
                    It is possible that a composition can be creative even though it is not appreciated by many people. Some measures of creativity 
                    include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Uniqueness:</b> Something that has never been seen before. Before Beethoven's 5th symphony, trombones have never been 
                            used in a symphony, which made this work new and exciting for listeners at the time (Yamaha).</li>

                        <li><b>Elaboration:</b> Something that builds on a creation that already exists. You can be creative in this way by writing 
                            a variation on an existing piece. Rachmaninoff wrote a piece for piano called "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini", in which
                            he writes 24 variations of a famous theme from Paganini's last caprice for violin (Wikipedia). The 18th variation is well known for 
                            the inversion of Paganini's melody, which you can listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThTU04p3drM">here</a>.</li>

                        <li><b>Variety:</b> Something that could have lots of different components to it. Again, the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini 
                            contains lots of variety: some variations are slow and romantic, others are fast and playful. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <p>
                Creativity in a domain requires prior knowledge in that said domain (Lecture 9). How can one be creative with music if they know
                nothing about music? One needs to know at least something about how music works, e.g. what different instruments sound like, how 
                to read notes on a staff, how to write certain rhythms, etc. The composition strategies in this section can act as this prior 
                knowledge as well. It is a starting point for one's work, the toolbox needed to learn to compose, in addition to musical knowledge.
