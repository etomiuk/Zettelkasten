        <h1>Images in music</h1>
            <p>
                Listen to the following exerpt and think about the images or ideas that come to mind when listening to it:

                <video controls> 
                    <source src="../../videos/adventure_mid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    Video not available
                </video>

                Maybe you heard a windy sound and felt a sense of cold? Or perhaps a feeling of isolation because of the very little 
                amount of instruments that are playing? Or maybe a feeling of dread or 
                anxiety with the constant timpani roll, the bells and the building up of the music? All these are examples of imagery 
                that are evoked by music. Composers often try to evoke certain feelings and images when they write their music so that 
                their listeners can feel like they are someplace else. This imagery can be visual (like trying to express a battle 
                scene), auditory (simulating the sound of the wind), or emotional (simulating anxiety). The exerpt above is part of a composition
                I wrote for wind band. The goal of the entire piece is to express the journey of a hero according to Joseph Campbell's Hero Cycle, 
                and this particular section is the apotheosis, where the hero finds him/herself ready to confront the major obstacle in their 
                adventure (hence the feeling of a "final countdown" emulated by the bells and the intense buildup of sound as the hero defeats
                their enemy).
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagery helps us better remember certain kinds of information because it provides an additional retrieval cue for information we try 
                to remember (Ormrod, 2017). It also allows us to encode information in a separate modality. It is a way to form new connections between
                our memories because then we can form associations between things like sound and a place for instance. 
            </p>

            <p>
                While music can evoke images, I think that images can also evoke music as well! Composers often "hear" their music they
                compose in their head. Perhaps this music is triggered by a particular event, a scenery, or a story. This is called auditory imagery 
                (Ormrod, 2017). So if ever you lack inspiration, maybe take a walk somewhere, get inspired by places, people, events and write music
                assocated to those things!
