        <h1>Hammering emotions in listeners</h1>
            
            <p>
                Emotion is often central to making pieces interesting and memorable. Composers take advantage of how much we are moved
                by emotions to create great pieces.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                If emotions are continuously paired with a neutral stimulus along with a unconditioned stimulus, then according to <a href="../../learning/behavourism.html">behaviourist</a>
                theories such as classical conditioning, this stimulus can eventually cause this emotion on its own (Lecture 2). Therefore, 
                music can be composed to elicit certain feelings in this way when it is continously paired with some other stimulus. This is 
                something that film composers take advantage of. For instance, 
                listen to the following movie music:

                <audio controls src="../../audios/Jaws-theme-song.mp3">
                    <a href="../../audios/Jaws-theme-song.mp3"> Download audio </a>
                </audio>
                Taken from: https://orangefreesounds.com/jaws-theme-song/
            </p>

            <p> 
                We can recognize that as the Jaws theme song! If we interpret this according to the classical conditioning theory, we may be naturally scared of sharks.
                Therefore, sharks are like an unconditioned stimulus, and fear, the unconditioned response. By pairing this music repeatedly with sharks
                we might learn to experience anxiety and fear when hearing the Jaws theme song on its own, thus making the music become a conditioned stimulus.
                Fun anecdote: I made my mom listen to this song while I was writing this paragraph, and her first reaction was
                that she was scared, so I think the classical conditioning worked! :)
            </p>

        <h2>Emotions as a motivation</h2>
            <p> 
                Emotions are often deeply tied to the composer's personal experiences. We can feel the pain and suffering or the joy and 
                excitement in some pieces which in turn makes a piece more interesting and something we are more likely to pay <a href="./attention.html">attention</a>
                to. As described <a href="../../motivation/identity.html">here</a>, composers might write music to express themselves in a way that might
                not be possible using words or other forms of art. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Emotional music might hit us a certain way because they elicit some of our memories. From a neurological standpoint, this is because
                the hippocampus in our brain, the area that handles encoding of memories, is situated very close to the amygdala, the structure that 
                deals with emotions (Lecture 2). Therefore, emotion gets encoded with the event in long-term and can act as a retrieval cue for that memory (Lecture 4).
                Music that is romantic and intimate might remind someone of their first love for example. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, when you compose, always keep in mind the emotion or feeling you want to convey so that the audience can form the 
                connections between the music and personal experiences. This deeper connection with prior events will likely cause them to 
                better remember the piece because again, more retrieval cues are formed when encoding information about the music they are 
                hearing and thus, it will be easier to retrieve that information later on (Lecture 5), especially because the connections are 
                personal and relevant to the listener. Encourage a personal interpretation of a piece! The importance of emotions is also why 
                I was warning about the fact that <a href="../tech.html">music notation software</a> will not necessarily convey emotions because 
                the music is not being played by humans. 
            </p>

        <h2>How to convey emotion?</h2>
        <p>
            A few ways to convey emotion through music to help get started:
            <ul>
                <li>Major chords are happy, minor chords are sad. A change of mood can effectively be achieved by a simple switch in tonality.</li>
                <li>Indicate expression markings on the page so performers can know your musical intentions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
