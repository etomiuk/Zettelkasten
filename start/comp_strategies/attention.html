        <h1>Capturing and sustaining a listener's attention through music</h1>
            <p>
                Attention is critical in learning because it allows us to focus on a specific stimuli. By paying attention to certain
                stimuli, information about the stimuli is able to enter working memory to be worked with and processed and then it can be eventually 
                stored in long-term memory, as described by <a href="../../learning/cognitivism.html">cognitivist</a> theories (Lecture 4).
                Composers exploit features of our attention to create interesting music so that they are more memorable. Some stimuli
                that naturally capture attention have some of the following properties:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intensity:</b> Loud sounds will catch attention, think of a fire alarm or fireworks. Some instruments are naturally
                            louder than others. For instance, a trumpet can overpower a double bass. Composers will play around with dynamics 
                            as well as with the instrumentation (which instruments play and how many) to direct a
                            listener's attention. I did this in a Scherzo I wrote for orchestra. Compare the following two versions of it:

                        <div class="video-div">
                            <video class="video1" controls> 
                                <source src="../../videos/symphony3_boring.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                                Video not available
                            </video>

                            <video class="video2" controls> 
                                <source src="../../videos/symphony3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                                Video not available
                            </video>
                        </div>
                        

                        The second one is a lot more interesting that the first! That is because I repeat the same motif three times, 
                        but all of them having different intensities: the first one is medium intensity, the second is soft, and the 
                        third is very loud. I did this to create some interest and variety to retain the audience's attention for the 
                        end of that phrase before moving onto the next theme. The first version has no dynamic contrasts and the same number 
                        of instruments playing, making it seem very repetitive and boring. 

                        <p>
                            Another fun example of how composers easily use loudness to capture attention is
                            in Hayden's "Surprise Symphony".

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Novelty:</b> To make their pieces interesting, composers often introduce new themes, musical ideas, and
                        melodies in their pieces. They also experiment with new combinations of instruments to create new textures
                        or create new rhythms to add variety. Or else, if the piece just repeated the same melody in the same way,
                        it would be so boring, as we saw in my example above! Beethoven's 2nd movement of his 7th symphony uses a recurring theme throughout the 
                        entire movement that is repeated over and over again. Yet, it is not boring. The piece starts off with the melody 
                        in the lower strings:

                        <audio controls src="../../audios/beethoven7_intro.mp3">

                        </audio>

                        The melody is then embellished with  variations in the accompaniement as well as different instruments:
                        <audio controls src="../../audios/beethoven7_third.mp3">

                        </audio>

                        It is also repeated in a much more intense way with a complex accompaniment.

                        </audio>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Emotions:</b> Music often represents strong emotions. Classical composers, especially in the Romantic period,
                        are really skilled at eliciting emotions from their music. Emotions capture our attention because they might 
                        remind us of a personal event or feeling (details <a href="./emotion.html">here</a>).
                        Respighi's introduction for the Pines of Rome is very joyful and full of energy - how could you not smile when
                        listening to this intro? 

                        <audio controls src="../../audios/pines.mp3">
                            <a href="../../audios/pines.mp3"> Download audio </a>
                        </audio>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Personal preference:</b> Music that we like will capture our attention more and will probably be more
                        <a href="../comp_strategies/memory.html">memorable</a>. This is because we pay more things to things that motivate us, 
                        and things that motivate us are usually things that also interest us. I personally
                        really like music in minor keys with lots of emotion and mystery so music like the ending of Shostakovitch's 5th 
                        symphony (movement 1) will capture my attention and curiosity
                        and will entice me to continue to listen to it:
                    
                        <audio controls src="../../audios/shosta5.mp3">
                            <a href="../../audios/shosta5.mp3"> Download audio </a>
                        </audio>
                    
                        But this music might not capture your attention if that's not the kind of music you're into. In that sense, 
                        it is hard to please the entire audience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Choose your own adventure... but with music!</h2>
            <p>
                Using this list of characteristics that catch attention allows composers to manipulate and their listener's attention. 
                However, a listener also has control over what they attend to (Lecture 4). One thing that is really cool about music is that we can also choose to direct our attention to specific components
                of a piece. Classical composers might write several melodies at once and you can discover them by directing your 
                attention to a specific instrument for example. When writing music, there is often a melody and an accompaniment. 
                The melody is what we usually pay attention to and the accompaniment is what supports and embellishes the melody. 
                However, one can choose to pay attention to the acccompaniment as well if we want. Music is like a "melodic cocktail party"
                because there are often many melodies happening at the same time, and we can choose which one we attend to (McAdams, 2022).
            </p>

            <p>
                A piece I recently composed for band exploits the fact that there are different melodies one can listen to and I
                humbly think that this excerpt is a really cool example of the fact that you can choose which melody you want to 
                hear. I combine four different melodies which all work together. Try to direct your attention to each of these 
                melodies to discover them! If you can read music notation, you can follow the score to make it easier (the fourth one is
                a bit harder to hear though).
            </p>

            <h2>Starting and ending a piece</h2>
            <p> 
                Oftentimes it happens that we have a great idea for a piece, but we just don't know how to begin or end it. The primacy effect in cognitive
                psychology is the fact that we remember information that is presented first because it's the first thing we pay attention to and
                we have more time to process it (Lecture 4).  A good introduction is therefore crucial to catch a listener's attention so that they will
                want to listen to the rest of the piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the recency effect says that we remember the last thing that is presented to us because it is what
                is freshest on our minds. That means that the conclusion of a piece is what will probably remain in a listener's working memory
                after the piece is done, so it's important to have a strong ending to a piece to leave the listener with a positive impression.
