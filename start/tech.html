        <h1>Technologies used in composition</h1>
        <p>
            There are many ways one can write music: you can do it the good ol' fashion way of notating with pencil and paper, or you can 
            take advantage of the many music notation software available to write music. I personally use <a href="https://musescore.org/en">
            Musescore</a> because it is free and open-source (and their new update made their instruments sound sooooo much better!), but other
            options might be <a href="https://www.avid.com/sibelius">Sibelius</a> or <a href="https://www.finalemusic.com/">Finale</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes I start composing right away in Musescore, and other times, I write my ideas by hand, and then input it into Musescore. 
            Here is an example of some of my thought processes I had for the ending of a symphony I am working on, which I first put on paper, 
            then brought to life with Musescore! You can see some of the ideas from the written sketch appear in the final version in the video.

            Writing music in software or by hand each have their advantages or disadvantages, as discussed below. 
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages to using music notation software</h2>
        <p>
            Music notation software has several cognitive advantages compared to writing music the traditional way using pen and paper: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Formatting:</b> Typically, music composition software formats scores for you. Reading handwriting can be very difficult, so 
                    having all the notes looking consistent and well-placed reduces the cognitive load associated
                    to reading music both for someone who will play your music in the future and for yourself when you want to revisit your piece.
                    It will make your piece look more professional and ready to be published. 

                    Most music software is powerful enough to also automatically place some of the extra details necessary to your piece, such as dynamics, 
                    expression markings, titles, etc. In this sense, this auto-placement helps give more room for our germaine load so that we can focus
                    more on our music rather than visually understanding what we are writing. The point of composing is to write music, not to spend hours 
                    visually formatting things!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Hearing our music:</b> A HUGE advantage of music software is that it will play back our music without the need to hire 
                    musicians to play it for us or testing it ourselves on our instruments. This means we can "test" out our melodies before
                    having them performed. This can again alleviate lots of extrinsic load associated with 
                    trying to imagine how their ideas sound like, especially for novice composers who might not know the correct way of writing 
                    down their ideas in notation either because they don't understand how rhythms work yet, or because they might not have perfect/relative 
                    pitch to know which notes to use. Fiddling around with the notation in the software and fixing the melody until it sounds like how 
                    you want is not really something you can do just by writing music on paper, unless you have access to and know how to play the instrument
                    for which you are composing for. In this sense, it makes composition a bit more accessible to people who's like to compose, but who might 
                    not have the musical background to get started.
                    
                    <p>
                    Musescore's playback of my music helps me a lot in my work because I will often imagine a melody with a harmonization, but when I go to write it 
                    down and play the melody back to me, I realize it sounds pretty bad, which allows me to make some changes quickly. You can notice that 
                    not everything in my sketch above was included in the final version (for example, the second and third bars of the last line are three
                    quarter notes, but I doubled their length in my final piece because I thought that quarter notes were too quick). That's because I had tested my initial ideas out first, and changed 
                    them when I heard that my idea did not sound as expected. In a way, this software gives me feedback right away on what I am composing which might 
                    not be possible if I have to wait to hear the piece performed by musicians. This idea of immediate feedback is key in <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">operant conditioning</a>
                    because you will be less likely to produce a response to a stimulus if you delay the reward or punishment, and thus, you won't learn as well (Lecture 3).

                    However, this does comes with its own risks...
                </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Sharing is caring:</b> Having your music with you digitally makes it really easy for you to share it with other people. 
                    Just save the file and email it to a friend for them to play/listen to your piece!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations of music software</h2>
        <p>
            Music software is great, but it is not always the solution to all composition problems. Here are a couple of things to be aware of, especially if you are a novice
            composer:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hearing our music:</b> Hearing what the music sounds like is great, but obviously computerized instruments will not sound like 
                    real musicians: they have no emotions nor subtlty in they way they produce sounds to fit certain moods and contexts. So be careful 
                    not to modify the song to fit the sound of the software's instruments. It is important to still learn a bit about how instruments work 
                    so that the piece sounds good in a live performance.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Learning curve of how to use the software:</b> Software are not always immediately obvious to use. There is a steep 
                    learning curve to learning these technologies which can decrease one's motivation to learn composition: if the software is so 
                    hard to use, how will you ever be able to begin composing? This learning curve adds quite a bit of extraneous load because on top of 
                    having to think of the original melody to write, you also need to learn how to write the music using a computer in a way that won't 
                    hinder your workflow. 
                    
                    <p>
                    In Musescore, there is the "slow" way of inputting notes, and there is 
                    the more complicated and "fast" way to input notes. The slow way involves using the mouse and clicking on the line in which you
                    put the note and you have to manually click the note value at the top of the change to change the rhythm. The fast way involves 
                    inputting notes using the letters on the keyboard and changing note values using the numbers, which means that you need to memorize
                    which note value is associated with which number, which is extra cognitive effort to learn. Luckily, many resources exist to answer questions we might have, such 
                    as documentation or online communities. After lots of years of using Musescore, although I am not completely an <a href="../challenges/challenges.html">expert</a> in the software, 
                    I have developed an automaticity in how I write my melodies, so I no longer have to consciously think about which keys I need to press 
                    if I want to write a eighth note A for instance. This gives me extra room in my working memory for me to think about more 
                    important issues when composing (lecture 6).</li>
