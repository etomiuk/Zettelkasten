        <h1>Technologies used in composition</h1>
        <p>
            There are many ways one can write music: you can do it the good ol' fashion way of notating with pencil and paper, or you can 
            take advantage of the many music notation software available to write music. I personally use <a href="https://musescore.org/en">
            Musescore</a> because it is free and open-source (and their new update made their instruments sound sooooo much better!), but other
            options might be <a href="https://www.avid.com/sibelius">Sibelius</a> or <a href="https://www.finalemusic.com/">Finale</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages to using music notation software</h2>
        <p>
            Music notation software has several cognitive advantages compared to writing music the traditional way using pen and paper. 
            <ol>
                <li><b>Formatting:</b> Music sheet formatting is done for you! Reading someone's handwriting can be very difficult, so 
                    having all the notes in the perfect spot along with the correct spaces between them reduces the cognitive load associated
                    to reading music both for someone who will play your music in the future, and for yourself when you want to revisit your piece because
                    it will make your piece look more professional and ready to be published.
                    Most music software is powerful enough to also have this sort of auto-placement of the extra formatting stuff, such as dynamics, 
                    expression markings, titles, etc. In this sense, this auto-placement helps give more room for our germaine load so that we can focus
                    more on our music rather than visually understanding what we are writing. The point of composing is to write music, not to spend hours making music legible! 
                        ***insert image comparing handwritten sketch of a piece vs notation software
                </li>
                <li><b>Hearing our music:</b>A HUGE advantage of music software is that it will play back our music without the need to hire 
                    musicians to play it for us or testing it ourselves on our instruments. This means we can "test" out our melodies before
                    having them performed. This can again alleviate lots of extrinsic load, especially for novice composers, associated with 
                    trying to imagine how their ideas sound like. A challenge that novice musicians face is how to translate a melody they have 
                    in their head into music, either because they don't understand how rhythms work yet, or because they might not have perfect/relative 
                    pitch to know which notes to use, so fiddling around with the notation in the software and fixing the melody until it sounds like how 
                    you want. This helps me a lot in my work because I will often imagine a melody with a harmonization, but when I go to write it 
                    down and play the melody back to me, I realize it sounds pretty bad, which allows me to make some changes quickly.
                    However, this comes with its own risks, discussed next.</li>
                <li><b>Sharing is caring:</b>having your music with you digitally makes it really easy for you to share it with other people. 
                    Just save the file and email it to a friend for them to play/listen to your piece!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations of music software</h2>
        <p>
            Music software is great, but it is not always the solution to all composition problems. Here are a couple of things to be aware of:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Hearing our music:</b> Hearing what the music sounds like is great, but obviously computerized instruments will not sound like 
                    real musicians: they have no emotions and no subtlty in they way they produce sounds to fit certain moods and contexts. So be careful 
                    not to modify the song to fit the sound of the software's instruments.</li>
                <li><b>Learning curve of how to use the software:</b> software are not always immediately obvious to use. There is a steep 
                    learning curve to learning these tehnologies which can decrease one's motivation to learn composition: if the software is so 
                    hard to use, how will you ever be able to begin composing? In Musescore, there is the "slow" way of inputting notes, and there is 
                    the more complicated and "fast" way to input notes. The slow way involves using the mouse and clicking on the line in which you
                    put the note and you have to manually click the note value at the top of the change to change the rhythm. The fast way involves 
                    inputting notes using the letters on the keyboard and changing note values using the numbers, which means that you need to memorize
                    which note value is associated with which number, which is extra cognitive effort to learn. Luckily, many resources exist to answer questions we might have, such 
                    as documentation or online communities. </li>
