        <h1>The role of experience in composition</h1>

            <p>
                There is no doubt that our experiences can shape a composer's compositions. These experiences can be of many forms: 
                they can relate to the culture they belong to, the people they encounter, their teachers, world events that affect them, 
                or even just mundane experiences from daily life. There is simply no way that a work can be understood without taking
                into account someone's experience, whether it be the individual's personal experiences, or the experience of a 
                collective group of people (Lecture 8).
                Listeners also come in with their own personal experiences when they listen to a piece, which can influence how they 
                interpret it. In my opinion, this is what makes music, and the arts in general, so interesting!
            </p>

            <p>
                Because our experiences are unique to us, this inherently makes our compositions unique and creative: it gives the piece
                a personal touch that no one else would be able to achieve because no one else has lived and worked with the experiences
                you have gone through. You create your own personal style by building on your 
                acquired knowledge (which might have been passed down from <a href="social/modelling.html">role models</a>) and adding 
                in your own ideas. In this sense, you are creating new knowledge in the music world in this <a href="../learning/constructivism.html">
                constructivist</a> way because of your unique experiences that are brought into your compositions. 
                </p>            

        <h2>Musical Experience</h2>
             <p>
                The previous knowledge we have influences a task we learn, whether this knowledge is related to the task or not.  When learning to compose, it is evident that previous musical
                experience can help when writing a piece, which is a near transfer of knowledge.
                By being exposed to music, you implicitly learn some patterns, such as what 
                chords sound like, what instruments sound like, what notes fit in a certain key signature, the beat of a song, etc. which can be 
                heavily influenced by your <a href="./culture.html">culture</a>. 
                This knowledge can make it easier for you to learn to compose a song. I have no music theory background, but because I have 
                been playing violin for a very long time, I have implicitly acquired knowledge regarding what good compositions sound like compared
                to ones that are less appealing. Sometimes, I "just know" how to write a certain passage based on my implicit knowledge because
                I get to writing it on paper. Someone with little musical experience might struggle more to even come up with a good sounding melody
                because of their lack of experience, which is why novices might struggle getting a coherent idea to begin composing. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, as a classical musician, I don't think that I would be very good at composing a jazz piece because it is quite hard to 
                transfer my knowledge about classical composition to jazz. Music basics surely can help (such as idetifying notes and rhythms), but 
                I know that the rhythms and chords used in jazz are quite different but I don't know exactly what they are. This might be an instance where my classical music knowledge might be
                a negative transfer to learning to compose a jazz piece because I might bring in too many classical elements to a jazz piece that might
                not fit with the ~vibes~.
