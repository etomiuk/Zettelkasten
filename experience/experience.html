        <h1>The role of experience in composition</h1>

            <p>
                There is no doubt that our experiences can shape a composer's compositions. These experiences can be of many forms: 
                they can relate to the culture they belong to, the people they encounter, their teachers, world events that affect them, 
                or even just mundane experiences from daily life. There is simply no way that a work can be understood without taking
                into account someone's experience, whether it be the individual's personal experiences, or the experience of a 
                collective group of people (Lecture 8).
                Listeners also come in with their own personal experiences when they listen to a piece, which can influence how they 
                interpret it. This is what makes music, and the arts in general, so interesting in my opinion!
            </p>

            <p>
                Because our experiences are unique to us, this inherently makes our compositions unique and creative: it gives the piece
                a personal touch that no one else would be able to achieve because no one else has lived and worked with the experiences
                you have gone through. You create your own personal style by building on your 
                acquired knowledge (which might have been passed down from <a href="social/modelling.html">role models</a>) and adding 
                in your own ideas. In this sense, you are creating new knowledge in the music world in this <a href="../learning/constructivism.html">
                constructivist</a> way. 
            </p>

            <p>
                An example of one of my more creative compositions is a work in progress called "Space Exploration". In short, this project started
                off as a CEGEP project for a fine arts class where we needed to create a project related to space (as in planets and stuff). 
                I took inspiration from Holst, who wrote an entire suite called "The Planets", but I gave it my own twist. Holst's suite describe the 
                planets as Roman gods and expressed their character through music (he used titles such as "Mars, the Bringer of War"). I chose 
                to depict planets in a more scientific way by describing the feeling of living on that planet. I composed in a style sort of 
                similar to Holst because I imagined the piece to be somewhat modern-ish and cinematic because I was describing a story of a space 
                travel. In this sense, the creativity of this piece came from prior knowledge I needed to gather about the solar system, as well
                as prior knowledge about composition. Without these experiences, the piece would not be what it is today!
