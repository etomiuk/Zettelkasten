        <h1>The role of experience in composition</h1>

        <p>
            There is no doubt that our experiences can shape a composer's compositions. These experiences can be of many forms: 
            they can relate to the culture they belong to, the people they encounter, their teachers, world events that affect them, 
            or even just mundane experiences from daily life. There is simply no way that a work can be understood without taking
            into account someone's experience, whether it be the individual's personal experiences, or the experience of a collective group.
        </p>

        <p>
            What also matters is a listener's experience when listening to a song. ***elaborate on this --> different interpretations
            of a piece 
        </p>

        <h4>The role of experience for creativity</h4>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, one way of learning composition could be copy an idea from another composer and building on top of it (link to modelling section). 
            That way you create something that is unique to your style by building on top of knowledge that has been passed down by role models. 
            (see creativity section in composition strategies).
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
            Our unique experiences and interests (link to motivation) are also sources of creativity. Everyone's life is different, so it makes sense that if your music 
            is some sort of reflection of your personal experiences, that your music is different than someone else's. ***find an example of 
            a composer who had a unique take on a topic and expressed it through music***
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
            I don't consider myself to be a super creative person in music because I am not an expert composer yet (link to expertise). 
            I feel like I am still at the stage where I learn by imitation of talented composers (see modelling - power/prestige), which
            is probably why I don't find my compositions super creative, because they sound similar to other people's compositions. However, 
            I try very hard to give a personal flavour to compositions. 
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
            An example of one of my more creative compositions I like is a work in progress called "Space Exploration". In short, this project started
            off as a CEGEP project for a fine arts class where we needed to create a project related to space (as in planets and stuff). 
            I took inspiration from Holst, who wrote an entire suite called "The Planets", but I gave it my own twist. Holst's suite describe the 
            planets as Roman gods and expressed their character through music (he used titles such as "Mars, the Bringer of War"). I chose 
            to depict planets in a more scientific way by describing the feeling of living on that planet. I composed in a style sort of 
            similar to Holst because I imagined the piece to be somewhat modern-ish and cinematic because I was describing a story of a space 
            travel. In this sense, the creativity of this piece came from prior knowledge I needed to gather about the solar system, as well
            as prior knowledge about composition. Without these experiences, the piece would not be what it is today! 

            ***insert audio of planets - whole mvt or part of a few?
