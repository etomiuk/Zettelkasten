      <h1>Culture and composition</h1>
      <p>
            Culture defines a context in which we learn (lecture 9). 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (*** integrate with "power and prestige from modelling") The historical models we use for classical composers are (mostly) all white European men. 
        These were the people who have had the most influence on classical music as we know it today. It is very rare that orchestras from anywhere in the world will 
        perform pieces from a 19th century Indian composer for instance... ***why is it this way? maybe look a bit into the history -- having to do with 
        the importance of european history...). However, is it possible that we are missing some perspectives from other groups that 
        tend to be underrepresented in composition? Would this demotivate other demogrphic groups
        that don't look like the model from composing? (see modelling)
            <ul>
                <li>Women: I can only think of three famous women classical composers that can serve as potential models to learn from
                     (Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn, Nadia Boulanger)</li>
                <li>What about Black composers? Asian composers? Indigenous composers? What can we learn about composition from different non-European cultures?</li>

        However, these white composers are inspired by other cultures in their music: Dvorak New World Symphony being heavily
        influenced by Native American folk songs and culture, Borodine for steppes of Central Asia, Debussy had lots of Asian influences I think
        (do some research on this -- connect to culture). 
                
            </ul>

        <li>Are we missing musical perspectives from other cultures? Composers write treatises about how to compose, but that is definitely
            NOT an absolute truth... different cultures have different instruments, rhythms, scales, etc. --> study on what sounds natural to 
            one culture is not in another (MUMT)
        </li>
        <li>What are we doing when we celebrate underrepresented groups in composition (women, BIPOC, queer, etc.), 
            or in classical music in general (we see this in conducting as well)? </li>
      </ul> 

      <p> *** move the culture scales to this section</p>
