      <h1>Culture and composition</h1>

        <p>
            Culture defines a context in which we learn composition and, thus, will affect the way and style in which we approach
            composition (Lecture 8). Different cultures approach all aspects of life in a different way. Cultures shape the way we think about 
            ourselves and others, the way we learn and solve problems to the point where it might affect our memory or attention processes
            for instance (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine). Cultures will also affect what motivates us and what interests us
            and <a href="./social.html">who</a> we learn from. 
        </p>

        <p>Different cultures have different music, so it seems natural that composers from different cultures have different composing styles, and that future people coming 
            from similar cultures adopt similar styles as well. It even goes as far as different cultures have different scale modes. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
            is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
            background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
            to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).
        </p>

        <h2>What do we learn from our culture?</h2>

            <p>
                Culture gives us knowledge that we may not even know we have. This is called implicit knowledge (Lecture 5). We gain such knowledge
                simply through exposure to anything in our lives, also known as implicit learning. This type of learning doesn't require
                much attention on our part which is why we might not even be aware that we have this knowledge. In this sense, cultures 
                implicitly teach us things that influence how we behave and think and of course, compose music! I know that my music is 
                for sure influenced by the way Western composers write.  
            </p>

            <p>
                An example in music are different scales that are used in different cultures (Kendall). When living in
                a certain culture, you are likely to listen to that culture's music. Through constant repetition and exposure to this kind 
                of music, the style and features might become implicit knowledge and might define what even sounds natural to you.
                Unless you are a music theorist intersted in studying 
                this kind of thing, you are probably not trying to learn what the patterns of the scales are.
                Therefore, these scales might be more likely to become the basis of your composition and define the way you write series of notes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Below are examples of different scales used in different cultures.

        <h2>Culture as a source of inspiration</h2>

            <p>
                Just because you belong to one culture doesn't mean that you have to only compose according to your cultural practises! 
                Being open to new ideas from diverse areas is a great way to be inspired to write music that might push you outside your
                comfort zone. Many composers used elements of music from other cultures to properly convey their ideas. For instance, Dvorak's 
                famous New World Symphony was heavily inspired by African American spiritual and plantation songs as well as Native American
                dances (Schwarm, 2015). 
            </p>
        
        <h2>Missing cultural perspectives in composition</h2>
            <p>
                When we speak of classical music, usually we refer to the Western traditions
                of composition, which were generally developped by white European men.
                These were the people who have had the most influence on classical music as we know it today, especially since some
                of them wrote treatises about how one should approach composition. However, these might not be absolute truths, given
                how free and creative composition is.
                Are we missing some perspectives from other underrepresented groups in composition, such as 
                women, BIPOC, or queer communities (Lecture 8)? What are we doing when we celebrate the composition of someone from such 
                underrepresented group?
                What can we learn about composition from different non-European cultures?
            </p>

            <p>
                These are questions I don't have an answer to, but I think it is important to be aware of these cultural influences in our work. 
                If someone don't look like or relate to their favourite composers, perhaps this could demotivate them to compose because they have no 
                evidence from a similar model that they can be successful in composition. This is why "relevance" is an important criteria that defines 
                a <a href="./social/modelling.html">model</a>. Schunk (2001) mentions that we tend to replicate behaviour from people who are more similar to
                us because then it is more likely that we obtain the same outcome as them.
