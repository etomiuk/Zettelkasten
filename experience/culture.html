      <h1>Culture and composition</h1>
      <p>
        Culture defines a context in which we learn. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Topics to address for this week's entry</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The historical models we use for classical composers are all white european men
            <ul>
                <li>Women: there are a few (Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelshon, Nadia Boulanger are the only names I can come up with - 
                    also all from post-classical....)</li>
                <li>What about Black composers? Asian composers? Indigenous composers?</li>
                <li>However, these white composers are inspired by other cultures in their music: Dvorak new world symphony expressing 
                    3rd mvt about the native people in america, Borodine for steppes of central asia, debussy had lots of asian influences
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Are we missing musical perspectives from other cultures? Composers write treatises about how to compose, but that is definitely
            NOT an absolute truth... different cultures have different instruments, rhythms, scales, etc. --> study on what sounds natural to 
            one culture is not in another (MUMT)
        </li>
        <li>What are we doing when we celebrate underrepresented groups in composition (women, BIPOC, queer, etc.), 
            or in classical music in general (we see this in conducting as well)? Do we have an inherent bias about how good
            a piece sounds based on the composer (compositions are associated to your name, they become part of your identity 
            as a composer, it is what you are known for)? </li>
      </ul>
