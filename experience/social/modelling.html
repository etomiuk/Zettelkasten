        <h2>Modelling</h2>
            
            <p>
                There are several criteria that define a good model.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Competence:</b> the model is an <a href="../knowledge/expertise.html">expert</a> at the topic. This is why we would seek feedback from other 
                    people who have composed before because they can give valuable tips on how to write certain passages, or how to express your ideas in music. For instance, 
                    I have learnt from my band teacher the importance of writing rhythms in a way that makes it easier to interpret for music students. I learned that it is easier
                    to write syncopated rhythms by emphasizing where the beats are. </li>
                    <img class="piano-imgs" src="../imgs/model_ex.png">

                    <li><b>Power & Prestige:</b> the model is well known and influential. Composers will often be influenced by the big names in classical music: Beethoven, Bach, 
                    Chopin, Debussy, etc. because they were known to have created very influential pieces of music that we still know and play to this day. My style has certainly been 
                    influenced by these great composers to the point where I model and use their melodies as a starting point for an idea. The following example
                    is the introduction for a piece that is heavily inspired by Mendelssohn's "Reformation" Symphony. </li>                    <br>

                    </audio>
                    <p>Source: IMSLP</p>
                        
                    <li><b>Relevant:</b>the model is someone who is similar to the learner. Composers will probably be inspired by people whose pieces they enjoy so they might write
                    more like them. Furthermore, composers would probably have models that come from similar cultures. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
                    is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
                    background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
                    to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p style="color:red;">
                Models are crucial for learners because they pass down their knowledge on a subject, whether they are a teacher 
                who can guide you in a project or a famous person whom you don't know personally but look up to because of their role
                the domain in which you learn. Models can serve as starting points for creative work by inspiring learners with their 
                knowledge. (link to creativity) 
            </p>

            <p style="color:red;"> 
                Models and scaffolding - can scaffolding really help in composition?
            </p>

            <p>Several cognitive processes are involved in modelling (make the connections with memory and attention here)</p>
