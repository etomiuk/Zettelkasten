        <h1 id="social">Learning as a social experience</h1>
            <p>Learning is also a very social. Learning often involves someone teaching you something, whether it is a physical teacher
                like in school, or an online teacher from a Youtube video, or from a book that teaches you something (Lecture 2). Learning to compose
                is also a very social thing. One rarely writes music for themselves - they write it for someone to play or 
                listen to it. A great quote from Victor Hugo expresses how music can teach you things that cannot be learnt in any other way:
            </p>
            <h4>"Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent" - Victor Hugo (ClassicFM)</h4>

            <p>One can learn to compose with a composition teacher, either at school or by finding a private teacher. I have personally seeked help
                from my previous orchestra conductor who is a famous Canadian composer, as well as my high school band teacher. My band teacher is especially
                helpful when I write band music because she is able to tell me if my pieces are playable on all the band instruments, as well as gives
                me ideas when I am stuck.
                
                Nowadays, there are many online 
                communities of composers (like in Facebook groups) that are there to give advice on others' compositions and that can help inspire 
                aspiring composers. Ertmer & Newby (2013) realized that recently, much of our learning occurs through conversation because knowledge
                and other people are much more accessible through the Internet. 
            </p>

        <h2>Social Cognitive Theory</h2>
            <p>This theory aligns with the fact that learning is very social. It proposes that much of our learning happens through obersation of others, practising, 
                and then getting feedback about our performance from others (Schunk, 20xx). As mentioned <a href="index.html#experience">here</a>, learning is often defined
                by experiences, including other pepole we encounter or inspire us. Schunk (20xx) mentions that we tend to replicate behaviour from people who are more similar to
                us because then it is more likely that we obtain the same outcome as them.
            </p>
            <p>Different cultures have different music, so it seems natural that composers from different cultures have different composing styles, and that future people coming 
                from similar cultures adopt similar styles as well. It even goes as far as different cultures have different scale modes. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
                is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
                background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
                to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).
            </p>
            <p>Insert example of different modes</p>

        <h2>How does someone teach you composition?</h2>
        <p>
            Direct instruction: giving lectures, showing students how to do something step by step. Is probably easier on the 
            cognitive load side of things because students are receiving the information rather than generating it themselves
            Unless the teacher is not good, which adds an extra extrinsic load. I'm assuming that composition classes in a music
            school setting would be like this? I have no idea though. 
            benefits: reduced cognitive load? you gain the prior knowledge --> useful if you're not an expert! remember that to 
            be creative you need to have the tools to be able to do so!
            drawbacks: students won't necessarily be active in the learning processes --> they don't make the deep processing connections
            themselves. (connect back to deep processing). Composition is a learn by doing type of thing. I don't think that students are 
            graded on how well they know how to copy a teacher's composition, they are probably graded on their own creative work where they workd
            with the material they are taught to form something novel.
        </p>

        <p>
            discovery learning: letting students create their own knowledge, discover how things work. Teachers are there sort 
            of as facilitators to make sure this process runs smoothly. This is totally based on constructivism!!! Composition
            probably benefits from this type of learning because it is a creative domain. Students play around with ideas in class
            and have their teacher take a look and give feedback so that they build on their knowledge in composition. 
            benefits: students can form their own connections to the material and actively learn it
            drawbacks: very difficult if no prior knowledge. how do you make sure students are really learning what they should
            be learning through this process?
        </p>
            
        <p>
            It is ideal to use both of these modes of instruction together: direct instruction to give them the prior knowledge, 
            and discovery learning to let them go on their own and play with the ideas they just learned swnd form those deep connections.
