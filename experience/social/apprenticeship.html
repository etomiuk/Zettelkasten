        <h1>Apprenticeship</h1>
            <p>
                Apprenticeship is when experts help a novice reach a goal or complete a task by transferring their knowledge over to
                the novice. Usually this knowledge is about how to think about a task more than how to perform a task. This is because
                a major difference between experts and novices is in the way experts have their knowledge organized. The experts have those 
                deep connections between their topics of expertise which helps them know when they should use certain piece of knowledge
                or when they should perform a certain action. If an expert composer told you how to compose a piece, as a novice, you might
                just follow what they say and your piece might end up sounding like something they would compose instead of reflecting your own 
                composition style. On the other hand, if your teacher teaches you how to <i>approach</i> a certain composition, then you're not
                set in a particular style or a series of steps to follow in order to achieve the desired product. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 6 components to apprenticeship:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Modelling:</b> when a novice observes an expert execute a task. This is described more in detail in this section (link to modelling)</li>
                    <li><b>Coaching:</b> when an expert observes a novice perform a task and provides feedback on their performance.</li>
                    <li><b>Scaffolding:</b> when an expert guides a novice in a series of steps to reach a goal, with the ultimate
                    goal to be to be able to execute the task on their own. Composition is such a personal activity that it doesn't make 
                    sense to always have someone by your side guiding you through how to write a piece all the time. </li>
                    <li><b>Articulation:</b> the novice articulates their steps and why they are chosing to do these steps</li>
                    <li><b>Reflection:</b> the novice reflects on their learning process and compare their results to an expert's process. ***how useful is this for composition bc you don't want to necessarily copy someone</li>
                    <li><b>Exploration:</b> the novice creates their own problems and questions to solve (?)s</li>
                </ul>

                *** will expand on this and form the connections
            </p>
