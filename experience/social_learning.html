        <h1 id="social">Learning as a social experience</h1>
            <p>Learning is also a very social. Learning often involves someone teaching you something, whether it is a physical teacher
                like in school, or an online teacher from a Youtube video, or from a book that teaches you something (Lecture 2). Learning to compose
                is also a very social thing. One rarely writes music for themselves - they write it for someone to play or 
                listen to it. A great quote from Victor Hugo expresses how music can teach you things that cannot be learnt in any other way:
            </p>
            <h4>"Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent" - Victor Hugo (ClassicFM)</h4>

            <p>One can learn to compose with a composition teacher, either at school or by finding a private teacher. I have personally seeked help
                from my previous orchestra conductor who is a famous Canadian composer, as well as my high school band teacher. My band teacher is especially
                helpful when I write band music because she is able to tell me if my pieces are playable on all the band instruments, as well as gives
                me ideas when I am stuck.
                
                Nowadays, there are many online 
                communities of composers (like in Facebook groups) that are there to give advice on others' compositions and that can help inspire 
                aspiring composers. Ertmer & Newby (2013) realized that recently, much of our learning occurs through conversation because knowledge
                and other people are much more accessible through the Internet. 
            </p>

        <h2>Social Cognitive Theory</h2>
            <p>This theory aligns with the fact that learning is very social. It proposes that much of our learning happens through obersation of others, practising, 
                and then getting feedback about our performance from others (Schunk, 20xx). As mentioned <a href="index.html#experience">here</a>, learning is often defined
                by experiences, including other pepole we encounter or inspire us. Schunk (20xx) mentions that we tend to replicate behaviour from people who are more similar to
                us because then it is more likely that we obtain the same outcome as them.
            </p>
            <p>Different cultures have different music, so it seems natural that composers from different cultures have different composing styles, and that future people coming 
                from similar cultures adopt similar styles as well. It even goes as far as different cultures have different scale modes. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
                is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
                background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
                to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).
            </p>
            <p>Insert example of different modes</p>

            <h2>Modelling</h2>
            
            <p>
                There are several criteria that define a good model.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Competence:</b> the model is an <a href="../knowledge/expertise.html">expert</a> at the topic. This is why we would seek feedback from other 
                    people who have composed before because they can give valuable tips on how to write certain passages, or how to express your ideas in music. For instance, 
                    I have learnt from my band teacher the importance of writing rhythms in a way that makes it easier to interpret for music students. I learned that it is easier
                    to write syncopated rhythms by emphasizing where the beats are. </li>
                    <img class="piano-imgs" src="../imgs/model_ex.png">

                    <li><b>Power & Prestige:</b> the model is well known and influential. Composers will often be influenced by the big names in classical music: Beethoven, Bach, 
                    Chopin, Debussy, etc. because they were known to have created very influential pieces of music that we still know and play to this day. My style has certainly been 
                    influenced by these great composers to the point where I model and use their melodies as a starting point for an idea. The following example
                    is the introduction for a piece that is heavily inspired by Mendelssohn's "Reformation" Symphony. </li>                    <br>

                    </audio>
                    <p>Source: IMSLP</p>

                    <li><b>Relevant:</b>the model is someone who is similar to the learner. Composers will probably be inspired by people whose pieces they enjoy so they might write
                    more like them. Furthermore, composers would probably have models that come from similar cultures. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
                    is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
                    background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
                    to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Several cognitive processes are involved in modelling (make the connections with memory and attention here)</p>
