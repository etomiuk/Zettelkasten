        <h2>Previous knowledge</h2>

        <p>
            The previous knowledge we have influences a task we learn, whether this knowledge is related to the task or not. Sometimes, 
            this knowledge can help us learn a new task easily, which is called a positive transfer, and sometimes, it can even hinder
            and interfere with our learning, which is a negative transfer (Lecture 9). It may also be possible that this knowledge may not have an 
            effect on the new thing we try to learn, which is a zero transfer, but that is more rare.  
        </p>

        <p> 
            If our previous knowledge and skills are related to the new task we are learning, this is called a near transfer, since 
            the transfer of knowledge and learning can easily connect. This type of transfer is a lot easier to do compared to a far transfer, 
            where we are transferring knowledge from a very different domain. When learning to compose, it is evident that previous musical
            experience can help immensly when writing a piece. By being exposed to music, you implicitly learn some patterns, such as what 
            chords sound like, what instruments sound like, what notes fit in a certain key signature, the beat of a song, etc. (connect to implicit learning). 
            This knowledge can make it easier for you to learn to compose a song. I have no music theory background, but because I have 
            been playing violin for a very long time, I have implicitly acquired knowledge (that I can't really describe becuase it is implicit)
            about how to make my piece sound good. Sometimes, I "just know" how to write a certain passage based on my implicit knowledge because
            I get to writing it on paper, whereas
            someone with little musical experience might struggle more to even come up with a good sounding melody. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, as a classical musician, I don't think that I would be very good at composing a jazz piece because it is quite hard to 
            transfer my knowledge about classical composition to jazz. Music basics surely can help (such as idetifying notes and rhythms), but 
            I know that the rhythms and chords used in jazz are quite different. This might be an instance where my classical music knowledge might be
            a negative transfer to learning to compose a jazz piece, because if I were asked to write a jazz piece, it might end up sounding
            like something classical. (fun fact, I have tried to write a more "fun" jazzy piece, can you tell that I am a classical musician?)
            ***insert example of the jazz trio piece.
