        <h1>Composition as a social experience</h1>

            <p>
                Learning often involves someone teaching you something, whether it is a teacher in school, or an online teacher
                from a Youtube video or from a book that teaches you something (Lecture 2). Much of our learning happens through observation
                of others, practicing, and then getting feedback about our performance (Schunk, 2001). Ertmer & Newby (2013)
                realized that recently, much of our learning occurs through conversation because knowledge and other people are much more
                accessible through the Internet. This idea that learning is very social comes from <a href="../learning/cognitivism/social_cognitivism.html ">social cognitivism</a>, 
                because indeed, there is this constant interaction between our environment, other people, and our learning.             
            </p>

            <p>
                Composition is also a very social activity. One rarely writes music for themselves - they write it for someone to play or 
                listen to it and we often look for feedback from others, whether it be another composer, musician, friend, or even from an 
                online community of composers.   
            </p>

        <h2>How does someone teach you composition?</h2>

            <p>
                There exist a variety of methods through which someone can teach you something. One of them is by direct instruction, which is when 
                a teacher will do most of the work by informing their students about the topic through lectures, examples, or instructions (Lecture 10). This is 
                what we traditionally would see in schools. This type of learning is ideal for students who are novices and possess no prior knowledge
                so it might be difficult for them to acquire or discover that knowledge on their own through exploration. In this sense, because 
                students are mostly just receiving the information without necessarily working with it in depth, it becomes easier on their cognitive 
                load. Then this knowledge can be used later on in creative tasks for instance. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The drawback is that the student is not the one making the deep connections to properly encode this new information in their 
                long-term memory since they are almost passively receiving the information. In this sense, I don't think that this is the best 
                way to teach composition, especially since composition is focused on a creative product. Of course, it is important to have 
                some knowledge of music before composition, but the ultimate goal is to create something that is unique to you without needing
                to copy the professor and being fixated on how the professor composes. This is why discovery learning might be 
                better suited to learn how to compose (Lecture 10). 
            </p>
            <p> In discovery learning, the role of the professor is scaffold and help the students
                who are actively working with the material by making the connections themselves (Lecture 6). 
                In this sense, this method is directly based on <a href="../learning/constructivism.html">constructivist</a> theories since students
                are the ones creating knowledge and discovering how things work. Learning composition in this way can be beneficial since students 
                could potentially play with musical ideas in class and have their teacher give feedback as they are working on it to build their 
                coposition knowledge. Because the students are the ones actively generating the knowledge, they will have an easier time encoding
                and retriving this knowledge later on because they are now forced to pay attention to the material themselves in order to be able to work
                with it. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Of course, a teacher can use both of these modes of instruction together: direct instruction to give students prior knowledge necessary 
                for a task and discovery learning to let them go on their own and play with the ideas they just learned. However in the end, 
                the goal should be for a student to be able to accomplish a task without constantly needing help from a teacher (Lecture 6).
