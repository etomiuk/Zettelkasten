## Questions!
Really sorry that this is a LOT of questions... if this is too much to read/answer, Q2 is the one I am most worried about.

1. It might not be possible to answer this without taking a look at the whole Zettel, but how is the balance between my connections to the topic and the connections back to course concepts? I feel like I have an imbalance where I focus more on my topic more than the connections between concepts (example, my page on mental health (why compose --> mental health) is basically a page where I attempt to apply concepts we learnt about transfer to composition, but it doesn't really connect to oter concepts...) *** I think you basically answered when I talked to you in class :)
2. I know I asked a similar thing a few weeks ago, but I wanted to know whether it's a bad thing to have a topic sort of scattered across my Zettel. For instance, I have a behaviourism page (under How to learn composition --> learning by changing behaviour), but I don't go in detail about classical/operant conditioning at all (but I feel like I should). But then I have a little example of conditioning under How to start composing --> Composition strategies --> Eliciting emotion. And then my last paragraph in my motivation page (the Why even compose page) connects motivation to operant conditioning. SO it feels like someone reading my behaviourism page might feel like there is something missing because I leave out the explanation of classical vs operant, even though it is on another page, but then someone reading the emotions page might wonder what is even behaviourism in the first place. I was going to hyperlink these two pages together, but I'm just unsure about the general organization, because this happens for many topics and I don't want to be too repetitive but I don't want to lose the reader because there are too many connections!!
3. Are my entries too long? I was reading the document on MyCourses about the Zettel and the examples you provide at the bottom and they are significanty shorter, and I'm afraid mine are way too wordy... What's your impression on this?
4. This is more of a design question, but thoughts on a "next page" button at the bottom of each page to direct a reader to the next page to read? Or is this sort of "linear" reading bad for the Zettel? I guess I organized the order of my topics in the navbar according to a natural order that would make sense to read for someone beginning to compose, but because of the connections made to other pages, it sort of disrupts this order. Another alternative can be a "related topics" section linking to similar topics to push those connections...I hope this makes sense!

## Week 7
### November 1
- NOTE: I colored this week's changes in red because now that I am integrating content within previous content, hopefully it will make it easier to spot what I have added.
- Also as a reminder, you can directly click on the broader topic for a sort of intro on the topic (I'm saying this because most of my creativity stuff is mostly under the Composition Strategies general page)
- Created a challenges section
    - Moved talent section here and added paragraph about growth vs fixed mindset
    - Made page for ZPD (will expand)
- Fixed broken navbar links (they should all work now!)

- Added page about music and mental health (connected to transfer)
### October 30
- Added creativity (spread out across the experience page, the social page, and composition strategies page)
  
## Week 6
### October 25
- The navbar got messed up: when you click on a new topic, you see the old navbar, so to go back to the correct one, you can click on the EDPE: Zettlekasten title at the top of the page. The correct one is the one on the "what is learning" page
- Renamed the motivation topics to "Why compose" with subtopics relating to why someone might want to compose a piece based on their interests, confidence, personal identity as a composer, etc.
- Added section on identity ("why compose" --> "Composition as part of identity")
- Added cultural influences in modelling (under experiences --> social)
- Added supportive learning environment in self-efficacy section (natural talent)
- Made the connections with cognitive load (self-efficacy and

## Week 5
### October 19
- I am aware that this week's entries might not be as good quality as previous weeks. After talking to you after class this week, I realized that what is taking up a lot of my time is forming the connections between topics. I find it easy to connect things to composition, but making the connections to previous weeks' content is hard (and I guess this ties into deciding where to move content around in the website). Any suggestions would be helpful :)
- Added motivation tab and the things that impact motivation (but I don't really like that it is isolated from the other topics...)
    - Choice, interest, self-efficacy, goals
- Officially reorganized the topics into broader, more composition related topics rather than following class order.
    - Renamed subtopics to relate them to composition
    - Fixed some links (the hyperlinks that link the topics are still a work in progress)
          - Don't click on the *some motivation topic* link under the experiences tab, nothing is there yet
          - Also the misc topics links don't work yet... I'm so sorry
    - Now you can click on a major topic and see a sort of intro text instead of only being able to access the subtopics
- Added humanism in theories
- Added broad blurb on experience
- I wanted to add metacognition but ran out of time
  

## Week 4
### October 13
- Created new navbar with reorganized topics (less focus on course order, more focus on organization based on my topic)
- This is what I am aiming for in my new organization:

### October 11
- Merged modelling page with some previous parts from social learning page + added more about modelling
- Added more about self-efficacy
- Added social cognitivism to cognitivism page + connections
- Moved some intro paragraphs to pages that connected better with them (like social cognitivism and implicit knowledge)
- Added connections to learning theories in intro.
- Added theory criticisms to connect to other topics
- Fixed broken links (still work left on that)
### October 10
- Added dropdown menu and reorganized topics into smaller subtopics
  - learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism, social cognitivism, constructivism
  - conditioning: classical, operant (I'd include this nested under behaviourism)
  - attention
  - memory: working, long term
  - knowledge: implicit, expertise
  - social learning:
  - strategies: encoding, processing
- Note: I'd like to have a "nested" dropdown menu to show a hierarchy of topics, but right now I don't have the technical skills to do that... I hope that is ok for this week
## Week 3
### October 3
- Reworked the organization of the pages
  - Moved learning theories to its own page (maybe I'll put it on the home page...)
  - Made conditioning to its own page, which is linked in learning theories
- Made a strategies page (not finished though)
- Note: for the final submission, I want to make a sort of dropdown menu for the larger topics and its subtopics so I don't have a bunch of links at the top of the page
### October 1
