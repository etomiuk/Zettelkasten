# Modification history
## Week 4
#### October 11
- Merged modelling page with some previous parts from social learning page + added more about modelling
- Added social cognitivism to cognitivism page + connections (but might move that to separate page eventually)
### October 10
- Added dropdown menu and reorganized topics into smaller subtopics
  - learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism (including social cognitivism), constructivism
  - conditioning: classical, operant (I'd include this nested under behaviourism)
  - attention
  - memory: working, long term
  - knowledge: implicit, expertise
  - social learning:
  - strategies: encoding, processing
- Note: I'd like to have a "nested" dropdown menu to show a hierarchy of topics, but right now I don't have the technical skills to do that... I hope that is ok for this week
## Week 3
### October 3
- Reworked the organization of the pages
  - Moved learning theories to its own page (maybe I'll put it on the home page...)
  - Made conditioning to its own page, which is linked in learning theories
- Made a strategies page (not finished though)
- Note: for the final submission, I want to make a sort of dropdown menu for the larger topics and its subtopics so I don't have a bunch of links at the top of the page
