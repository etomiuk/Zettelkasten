# Modification history
## Week 5
### October 19
- I am aware that this week's entries might not be as good quality as previous weeks. After talking to you after class this week, I realized that what is taking up a lot of my time is forming the connections between topics. I find it easy to connect things to composition, but making the connections to previous weeks' content is hard (and I guess this ties into deciding where to move content around in the website). Any suggestions would be helpful :)
- Added motivation tab and the things that impact motivation (but I don't really like that it is isolated from the other topics...)
    - Choice, interest, self-efficacy, goals
- Officially reorganized the topics into broader, more composition related topics rather than following class order.
    - Renamed subtopics to relate them to composition
    - Fixed some links (the hyperlinks that link the topics are still a work in progress)
          - Don't click on the *some motivation topic* link under the experiences tab, nothing is there yet
          - Also the misc topics links don't work yet... I'm so sorry
    - Now you can click on a major topic and see a sort of intro text instead of only being able to access the subtopics
- Added humanism in theories
- Added broad blurb on experience
  

## Week 4
### October 13
- Created new navbar with reorganized topics (less focus on course order, more focus on organization based on my topic)
- This is what I am aiming for in my new organization:

### October 11
- Merged modelling page with some previous parts from social learning page + added more about modelling
- Added more about self-efficacy
- Added social cognitivism to cognitivism page + connections
- Moved some intro paragraphs to pages that connected better with them (like social cognitivism and implicit knowledge)
- Added connections to learning theories in intro.
- Added theory criticisms to connect to other topics
- Fixed broken links (still work left on that)
### October 10
- Added dropdown menu and reorganized topics into smaller subtopics
  - learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism, social cognitivism, constructivism
  - conditioning: classical, operant (I'd include this nested under behaviourism)
  - attention
  - memory: working, long term
  - knowledge: implicit, expertise
  - social learning:
  - strategies: encoding, processing
- Note: I'd like to have a "nested" dropdown menu to show a hierarchy of topics, but right now I don't have the technical skills to do that... I hope that is ok for this week
## Week 3
### October 3
- Reworked the organization of the pages
  - Moved learning theories to its own page (maybe I'll put it on the home page...)
  - Made conditioning to its own page, which is linked in learning theories
- Made a strategies page (not finished though)
- Note: for the final submission, I want to make a sort of dropdown menu for the larger topics and its subtopics so I don't have a bunch of links at the top of the page
### October 1
