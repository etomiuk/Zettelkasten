        <h1>Attention</h1>
        <p>
          Attention is critical in learning because it allows us to focus on a specific stimuli. Composers exploit features of our attention to create interesting music.
          Some things that naturally capture attention and how they relate to composition:
          <ul>
              <li>Intensity: Loud sounds will catch attention. When I think about this one, I always think of one time in orchestra, we played Stravinski's Firebird suite, and 
                  there is a slow and soft movement followed by a very loud and intense movement. I wasn't playing at the end of the slow movement and rehearsal was getting long 
                  so I was starting to lose focus. When we began the next movement, my reaction almost looked like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnMv6-XTROY">this</a>. We can say
                  that I definitely started paying attention after that!

                  <p>Also, some instruments are naturally louder than others. Composers will play around with dynamics and with which instruments play with which and how many instruments will 
                  play at the same time to direct a listener's attention. Another fun example of how composers easily use loudness to capture attention is in Hayden's "Surprise Symphony".

              </li>
              <li>Novelty: To make their pieces interesting, composers often introduce new themes, musical ideas, and melodies in their pieces. They also experiment with new combinations of 
                  instruments to create new textures or create new rhythms to add variety. Or else, if the piece just repeated the same melody in the same way, it would be so boring!
              </li>
              <li>Emotions: Music often represents strong emotions. Classical composers (especially in the Romantic era) are really skilled at eliciting emotions from their music.</li>
              <li>Personal preference: Music that we like will capture our attention more and will probably be more <a href="#memory">memorable</a>.</li>
          </ul>

        </p>
        <p>One thing that is really cool about music is that we can also choose to direct our attention to specific components of a piece. Classical composers might write several melodies
            at once and you can discover them by directing your attention to a specific instrument for example. When writing music, there is often a melody and an accompaniment. The melody is what we
            usually pay attention to and the accompaniment is what supports and embellishes the melody. However, one can choose to pay attention to the acccompaniment as well. Music is like a "melodic
            cocktail party" because there are often many melodies happening at the same time, and we can choose what we listen to (McAdams, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>A piece I recently composed for band exploits the fact that there are different melodies one can listen to and I humbly think that 
            this excerpt is a really cool example of the fact that you can choose which melody you want to hear. I combine four different melodies which all work together. Try to direct your attention 
            to each of these melodies to discover them! If you can read music notation, you can follow the score to make it easier (though melody 4 is a bit harder to hear).
