        <h1>Cognitivism</h1>
            <p>Cognitivism is about using our mental capacities to learn (Ertmer & Newby, 2013). This is different from <a href="behaviourism.html">behaviourism</a>
            because these capacities are not immediately visible. Memory is a very important aspect of learning, and has been explained by the dual-store model (Lecture 4).
            </p>

            <p>The first part of the model is the sensory register, where information coming through the senses is perceived, but not yet processed. Because it its extremely limited
            capacity of a few seconds, only information we pay attention to will be further processed in working memory (Lecture 4). Only stimuli that have been attended to can be further 
            processed.
            </p>

        <h3 id="attention">Attention</h3>
            <p>Attention is critical in learning because it allows us to focus on a specific stimuli. Composers exploit features of our attention to create interesting music.
            Some things that naturally capture attention and how they relate to composition:
                <ul>
                    <li>Intensity: Loud sounds will catch attention. When I think about this one, I always think of one time in orchestra, we played Stravinski's Firebird suite, and 
                        there is a slow and soft movement followed by a very loud and intense movement. I wasn't playing at the end of the slow movement and rehearsal was getting long 
                        so I was starting to lose focus. When we began the next movement, my reaction almost looked like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnMv6-XTROY">this</a>. We can say
                        that I definitely started paying attention after that!

                        <p>Also, some instruments are naturally louder than others. Composers will play around with dynamics and with which instruments play with which and how many instruments will 
                        play at the same time to direct a listener's attention. Another fun example of how composers easily use loudness to capture attention is in Hayden's "Surprise Symphony".
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Novelty: To make their pieces interesting, composers often introduce new themes, musical ideas, and melodies in their pieces. They also experiment with new combinations of 
                        instruments to create new textures or create new rhythms to add variety. Or else, if the piece just repeated the same melody in the same way, it would be so boring!
                    </li>
                    <li>Emotions: Music often represents strong emotions. Classical composers (especially in the Romantic era) are really skilled at eliciting emotions from their music.</li>
                    <li>Personal preference: Music that we like will capture our attention more and will probably be more <a href="#memory">memorable</a>.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <p>One thing that is really cool about music is that we can also choose to direct our attention to specific components of a piece. Classical composers might write several melodies
                at once and you can discover them by directing your attention to a specific instrument for example. When writing music, there is often a melody and an accompaniment. The melody is what we
                usually pay attention to and the accompaniment is what supports and embellishes the melody. However, one can choose to pay attention to the acccompaniment as well. Music is like a "melodic
                cocktail party" because there are often many melodies happening at the same time, and we can choose what we listen to (McAdams, 2022).
            </p>
            <p>A piece I recently composed for band exploits the fact that there are different melodies one can listen to and I humbly think that 
                this excerpt is a really cool example of the fact that you can choose which melody you want to hear. I combine four different melodies which all work together. Try to direct your attention 
                to each of these melodies to discover them! If you can read music notation, you can follow the score to make it easier (though melody 4 is a bit harder to hear).

            <h3 id="memory">Working Memory</h3>
                <p>Working memory is the next component of the dual-store model of memory. This is where the information that successfully passed the sensory registers goes and is worked with.
                    Similar to the sensory register, it has time limits (~30 sec), as well as capacity limits (Lecture 4). 
                </p>
                <p>The primacy and recency effect explain why we remember certain types of information. The primacy effect says that we remember information that is presented first because it's 
                    the first thing we pay attention to and we have more time to process it, while the recency effect says that we remember the last thing that is presented to us because it is what
                    is freshest on our minds. For this reason, I think that a good composition needs a good introduction and conclusion. That way, the introction captures a listener's 
                    attention right away, and the conclusion will also be one of the last things they will remember of a piece. 
                </p>
                <p>Ormod (2017) talked about maintenance rehearsal as a way to keep information from slipping away from working memory. Personally, I find it difficult
                    to come up with original ideas for a new piece. Unfortunately, musical ideas always seem to come to me at the worst times: when I'm walking my dog, when I'm trying to study 
                    for a midterm, in my dreams, etc. It's important for me to remember these ideas before I lose them. When an idea comes, I constantly sing it to myself until I can go a write it down somewhere, either
                    on paper or in my music notation software. However, my melody ideas that are shorter are generally easier to remember because working memory has a limited capacity.
                </p>
                <p>Composers often "hear" their music they compose in their head. This is called auditory imagery (Ormrod, 2017). Perhaps combining the visual music notation with the auditory hearing
                    of the melody would lead to composers (and listeners) remembering their melodies better?
                </p>

        <h3 id="ltm">Long-Term Memory</h3>
            <p>The final stage in the duel-processing model is long-term memory, where important information form working memory goes and stays for longer periods of time. For information to get to long-term 
                memory, we need to conect it with information that is already there (Lecture 4). 
            </p>
            <p>Composers have many techniques to make their music memorable. 
            MUMT250: melodies are recognized by intervals more than scale degree, 
                        melodic contour is an important feature --> that's what we tend to recognize
            
            </p>
            <p>Even though rote memorization and mindless repetition will not necessarily make information stick in long-term memory, Ormrod (2017) claims that constantly reviewing can help
                keep information that is already encoded in long-term memory stay there longer, especially if the information is reworked and connected with other information. One advantage of this repetition
                is that automaticity (Ormrod, 2017). Composers might repeat a theme or melody often in a piece, but maybe in slightly different ways (to make it interesting - see <a href=#attention>ways of capturing attention</a>).
                We automatically know what the theme of the first movement Beethoven's 5th Symphony is, and one reason might be because it is constantly repeated throughout the entire piece, just slightly different each time.
            </p>
            <p>This automaticity might be advantageous because it makes us faster at executing a task (Ormrod, 2017). When I first started composing, I had to learn how my music notation software worked. I had some musical ideas, but it took
                a long time for me to figure out how to write it properly in musical notation because I was unfamiliar with how the software worked. Now, after I have practiced a lot, a lot of my music writing has become automatic, 
                which leaves me more room on my limited working memory to focus on my ideas.
            </p>
