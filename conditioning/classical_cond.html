        <h1>Conditioning</h1>
        <h2>Classical Conditioning</h2>
            <p>One key behaviourist theory is <b>Classical Conditioning</b>. Conditioning is the learning process where an unconditioned
                stimulus which causes an unconditioned response is repeatedly paired with a neutral stimulus so that the neutral stimulus 
                becomes a conditioned stimulus that causes a conditioned repsonse (Lecture 3). Music can be composed to elicit certain feelings
                in this way when it is continously paired with some other stimulus. For instance, listen to this famous music:
            </p>
            <audio controls src="../audios/Jaws-theme-song.mp3">
                <a href="../audios/Jaws-theme-song.mp3"> Download audio </a>
            </audio>
            <p>Taken from: https://orangefreesounds.com/jaws-theme-song/</p>
            <p> We can recognize that as the Jaws theme song! Under the classical conditioning theory, we may be naturally scared of sharks.
                Therefore, sharks are like an unconditioned stimulus, and fear, the unconditioned response. By pairing this music repeatedly with sharks
                we might learn to experience anxiety and fear when hearing the Jaws theme song on its own, thus making the music become a conditioned stimulus.
                Fun anecdote: I made my mom listen to this song while I was writing this paragraph, and her first reaction was
                that she was scared, so I think the classical conditioning worked! :)
