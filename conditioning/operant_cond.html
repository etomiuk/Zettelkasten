        <h1>Conditioning</h1>

        <h2>Operant Conditioning</h2>
            <p>Another behaviourist learning theory is <b>Operant Conditioning</b>. This theory
                is based on the idea that we can change behaviour if we provide rewards or punishments
                after a behaviour (Lecture 3). A lot of our learning is connected to our emotions, so reinforcements
                could be positive emotions such as happiness, pride, excitement, whereas punishments can be
                negative emotions we wish to suppress, like anger, sadness, or fear.
                In this sense, the sound of certain notes or chords could act like 
                a stimulus that causes reinforcement or punishment. In my experience, as a self-taught composer who has little 
                theoretical background on music, I depend a lot on experimentation to figure out the kind 
                of sound I am looking for. When certain chords or melodies sound bad, I am less likely to
                use those chords. These nasty feeling I get when listening to my bad chords or melodies can be like a positive punishment, since 
                I will never want to use that chord progression or melody again. An example from my own work
                is the following accompaniment to a nice bassoon melody I came up with this summer.

            <p>I personally think that that the D# in the violas sounds awkward and muddy. Therefore, because this sounds bad, 
                I will be less likely to produce music that sounds like this to avoid having to hear this nonsense again. 
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, certain effects I think sound good tend to appear a lot in my pieces.
                For instance, the sound of the horns and the sound of the timpani sound surprisingly good
                on Musescore, my music writing software. The chills I get when I listen to 
                their sound is like a positive reinforcement that makes me more likely to use them in my pieces. 
                Here are some excerpts of some of my compositions that feature and abuse these great sounds (Warning, the first audio is loud, but kind of epic)!

            <p>However, behaviourism cannot explain entirely how one learns to compose. Oftentimes, I am inspired
                by other composers and the way they use certain instruments or chords to create textures and effects 
                (see <a href="../index.html#social">Learning as a social experience</a>).
                This requires using knowledge and memory to learn these patterns (see <a href="../cognitivism.html">Cognitivism</a>), 
                which would go against behaviourist views that learning is solely an observable act.
