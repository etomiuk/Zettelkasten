Stylistic things
- put the EDPE355 Zettlekasten title in the center in the middle of the navbar
- split the navbar in two equal halves
- use margins based on percentage and not pixels (and maake margin for text not the same as navbar)
- make sheet music appear more natural with the background
- change color when hovering over hyperlinks
- horizontal list for list like items intead of being all veritcal --> put in a table?
- Related links (put subtopics at the bottom of the page?)
- convert audios+pics to videos --> embed musescore page if possible. 
    - for the attention last example, is there a way to play it 4 times and make the notes show up on each part individually?
