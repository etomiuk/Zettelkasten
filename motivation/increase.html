        <h1>Increasing motivation as a composer</h1>
            <p>
                Perhaps you are very motivated to write a song but you just cannot seem to get it right. You write notes on a page, but 
                when you play the song, it sounds awful! Maybe you're just not meant to compose... Maybe you aren't a musical 
                genius like Mozart was at 4 years old... 
                Can composition even be learned? Or are people just naturally be good at it? Well, of course it can be learned, 
                or else this website would be useless! But many cognitive factors can influence how well you learn something.
            </p>

            <h2>Building growth mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that your intelligence and abilities are innate and therefore cannot be changed is called a fixed mindset
                    (Lecture 6). Someone with a fixed mindset is more likely ot attribute their failures to some kind of fault in their
                    abilities. Such people will have more trouble bouncing back from setbacks because they don't they don't think they
                    can do anything to change their performance.
                    If you think that it is impossible to become more <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creative</a> because you
                    believe that creativity is something you are born with and that you cannot control, then it will be hard to 
                    <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> yourself to compose creatively (Lecture 7). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, it is better to adopt a growth mindset when learning. Growth minsets
                    promote a mastery approach to learning where your successes can be attributed to the effort you put in a task rather
                    than your innate intelligence (Lecture 6). Those with a growth mindset will believe that their intelligence and abilities can be
                    changed with effort and hard work.
                </p>

            <h2>Increasing self-efficacy</h2>

                <p>
                    Adopting a growth mindset can help increase self-efficacy, which in turn helps increase your motivation to pursue a task.
                    Self-efficacy relates to how well you think you can accomplish a task (Lecture 6). One's self-efficacy affects
                    one's behaviour and attitude towards a task. Those with high self-efficacy will be more likely to accomplish a 
                    difficult task because they are confident in their ability to finish it and they will work through the obstacles
                    they encounter. They are also more likely to set harder goals to challenge themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, if someone has low self-efficacy, they will be less likely to complete a task because they 
                    don't believe that they can accomplish it for whatever reason. In a way, low self-efficacy adds extraneous cognitive load
                    in addition to the intrinsic cognitive load due to the inherent difficulty of the task, which leaves little
                    room for germaine load that would be used to organize our ideas and leave room for <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity</a>.
                    In other words, low self-efficacy could potentially hinder one's composition abilities.
                </p>

            <h2>Appropriate goal-setting</h2>
                <p>
                    Composers might have many goals that motivate them to compose music. However, it is important to set realistic goals 
                    that will actually motivate you to complete a task. These goals can be found at many scales: maybe your goal is to create 
                    a 2 hour movie with a full soundtrack that you compose using a symphony orchestra. Or maybe that goal is way too ambitious and you
                    would simply like to be able to write a nice 4-bar melody with an accompaniment. If a goal is too ambitious, it is likely that your
                    self-efficacy will decrease especially if you do not have the skills and prior knowledge necessary to complete that goal. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Goals should also be relevant to the reason why you compose (Lecture 7). Are you trying to tell a story with music? Then maybe your goal should 
                    focus on the musical effects of your piece and the emotions it generates in an audience. The more the goals are relevant, the 
                    more motivated you'll be to actually stick with them. Focused goals also direct your attention towards specific parts of the task 
                    you try to accomplish (for instance, the emotions of a piece), which can help alleviate some extrinsic load associated with how 
                    overwhelming the task might be. Also, if the goal is relevant to you, you'll be more motivated to actually stick with it  because it
                    fosters more of that <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">intrinsic motivation</a> that is so important for us to keep pushing 
                    through difficult tasks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When thinking of your goals in comopsition, it is important to consider that there are some kinds of goals that will likely
                    lead to better results and learning. Two major types of goals are:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Mastery goal:</b> these are goals related to becoming really good at a skill, or developping expertise in a topic (Lecture 7). 
                    These are often intrinsically motivated especially when the skill you want to learn intersts you. For instance, you might set as a 
                    to write a flute solo in the piece you're writing because you want to master how to write music for flutes.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Performance goal:</b> these are goals that relate to your performance in a task. You might want to outperform others 
                    in a certain task (called approach-based goal) or you might want to avoid looking bad in front of other people (which are 
                    avoidance-based goals). For instance, you might set as a goal to use this really wild instrument in you composition so that you
                    can outperform some other composer who also puts wild instruments in their composition. Or you might add this instrument because 
                    you don't want to look like an incompetent composer if you don't use it.  </li>
                </ol>  
            

                <p>
                    Just like intrinsic motivation likely leads to better results on a task, mastery goals are usually better at producing 
                    better outputs in a task because of the same reason.
                </p>
