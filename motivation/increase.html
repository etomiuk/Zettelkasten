        <h1>Increasing motivation as a composer</h1>
            <p>
                Perhaps you are very motivated to write a song but you just cannot seem to get it right. You write notes on a page, but 
                when you play the song, it sounds awful! Maybe you're just not meant to compose... Maybe you aren't a musical 
                genius like Mozart was at 4 years old... 
                Can composition even be learned? Or are people just naturally be good at it? Well, of course it can be learned, 
                or else this website would be useless! But many cognitive factors can influence how well you learn something.
            </p>

            <h2>Building growth mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that your intelligence and abilities are innate and therefore cannot be changed is called a fixed mindset
                    (lecture 6). Someone with a fixed mindset is more likely ot attribute their failures to some kind of fault in their
                    abilities. Such people will have more trouble bouncing back from setbacks because they don't they don't think they
                    can do anything to change their performance.
                    If you think that it is impossible to become more <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creative</a> because you
                    believe that creativity is something you are born with and that you cannot control, then it will be hard to 
                    <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivate</a> yourself to compose creatively (Lecture 7). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, it is better to adopt a growth mindset when learning. Growth minsets
                    promote a mastery approach to learning where your successes can be attributed to the effort you put in a task rather
                    than your innate intelligence (Lecture 6). Those with a growth mindset will believe that their intelligence and abilities can be
                    changed with effort and hard work.
                </p>

            <h2>Increasing self-efficacy</h2>

                <p>
                    Adopting a growth mindset can help increase self-efficacy, which in turn helps increase your motivation to pursue a task.
                    Self-efficacy relates to how well you think you can accomplish a task (Lecture 6). One's self-efficacy affects
                    one's behaviour and attitude towards a task. Those with high self-efficacy will be more likely to accomplish a 
                    difficult task because they are confident in their ability to finish it and they will work through the obstacles
                    they encounter. They are also more likely to set harder goals to challenge themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, if someone has low self-efficacy, they will be less likely to complete a task because they 
                    don't believe that they can accomplish it for whatever reason. In a way, low self-efficacy adds extraneous cognitive load
                    in addition to the intrinsic cognitive load due to the inherent difficulty of the task, which leaves little
                    room for germaine load that would be used to organize our ideas and leave room for <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity</a>.
                    In other words, low self-efficacy could potentially hinder one's composition abilities.
