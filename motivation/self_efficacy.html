        <h2>Self-Efficacy</h2>
            <p>Self-efficacy relates to how well you think you can accomplish a task (Lecture 6). Other people can help us increase our self-efficacy by providing 
                <a href="./modelling.html">mentorship</a> during our learning. One's self-efficacy affects one's behaviour and attitude towards a task (Lecture 6).
                Those with high self-efficacy will be more likely to accomplish the task because they are confident in their ability to finish it, and they will 
                work through the challenges that are there. They are also more likely to set harder goals and challenge themselves (Leture 6).
            </p>

            <p>If someone has low self-efficacy, they will be less likely to complete a task because they are not good at it. 
                Sadly, this happens to me all the time. Often, I will start off with an idea, but it sounds horrible, so I am 
                not motivated to continue my piece (look at how many abandonned pieces I have *insert pic of these pieces*).
            </p>

            <p>A notable example of how self-efficacy deeply influences the pursuit of composition is with 19/20th century composer
                Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff finished writing his first Symphony, in which he had high hopes in. When the symphony was premiered
                for the first time, Rachmaninoff was not satisfied by its performance and how it sounded. His piece also received a lot of brutal 
                feedback from critics, saying that "there is a lot of feeling ... but no sense whatever" (Glazunov, source) and that it "leaves an evil
                 impression with its broken rhythms, obscurity and vagueness of form, meaningless repetition of the same short tricks" (Cui, source). 
                 Rachmaninoff basically gave up on his composition career for a while after the premiere and fell into a 3-year depression where he was 
                 unable to compose: "My confidence in myself had received a sudden blow. Agonizing hours spent in doubt 
                 and hard thinking had brought me to the conclusion that I ought to give up composing" (Rachmaninoff, source). Very dramatic...
            </p>

            <p>This shows how motivation is also very affected by social influences (link to social/experiences).</p>

            <p>Writer's block is real! **expand more on this and how it relates to self efficacy**</p>
