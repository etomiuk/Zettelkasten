        <h1>Why do composers compose?</h1>

            
            <p style="color:red;">
                Motivation is what drives us to begin and accomplish a task. If you are not motivated to compose, then why would
                you spend any effort composing?
            </p>

            <p style="color:red;">
                Motivation enables us to change our <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">behaviours</a> (Lecture 7). For instance, if a composition
                teacher tells you that you need to stop giving the violins the melody all the time, if you are motivated enough to improve
                your composition skills, you will change your piece and give the melody to perhaps the cellos instead. You have changed your
                behaviour in your compositions, demonstrating that you have learned how to make a piece more interesting.
            </p >

            <p style="color:red;">
                Motivation also interacts with our <a href="../learning/cognitivism.html">cognitive processes</a> (Leccture 7). When you are motivated
                to learn something, you will focus your attention more on what you need to learn, and therefore, information will be more likely 
                to be better processed in working memory and put into long-term memory later on. Because the task or subect you are learning 
                is motivating, it will relate closer to your values and your interests. These personal connections make it easier to deeply
                encode information you learn, making it easier to retrive at a later time (Lecture 3?). On top of that, because you'll gain knowledge more easily, 
                this new knowledge might serve as even more motivation to learn the topic in more detail. There is this constant back and forth
                between motivation and these cognitive processes. 
            </p>

        <h2>How are composers motivated?</h2>
            <p>
                Motivators can be divided in two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Intrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "in" you. Some examples of instrinsic motivators in the context of composition:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pure <a href="../motivation/identity.html">interest</a> for composing</li>
                        <li>Learning or developping a new skill, such as <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity (my personal motivator)</a></li>
                        <li>Wanting to express ideas, <a href="../comp_strategies/emotions.html">emotions</a>, or a story</li>
                        <li>Raising awareness about a certain topic that matters to you (***find which section connects to this)</li>
                    </ul>


                    *** might delete this
                    I am someone who is very drawn to sound effects (depicting and separating sounds, combining sounds). I 
                    have like ASMR/chills type responses when I listen to particular blends of sound that please me (it's a bit hard to explain).
                    Thus an intrinsic motivator for me, other than interest, is the possibility of creating new and interesting combinations of sounds/melodies (I 
                    know there's a better way to explain this...). If I like the melodies I create, I become more motivated to expand on my current 
                    work and build on it (connection to conditioning - similar example)
                </li>

                <li><b>Extrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "outside" to you. Some examples of extrinsic motivators:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Money or making a living out of composition</li>
                        <li>A deadline to submit a piece</li>
                        <li>Fame (who wouldn't want to be as cool as John Williams?)</li>
                        <li>Approval from society and demonstrating your self worth and creativity to other people</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    Approval is one extrinsic motivator that motivates me to continue pushing through a composition. If my piece is well
                    recieved by someone, then my <a href="../challenges/talent.html">self-efficacy</a> improves and I'll be likely to continue composing.
                    Approval could also be somewhat intrinsic because I can approve or disapprove of my own piece, which can motivate me as well (?).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Intrinsic motivators are often what motivate us more to accomplish a task because those are the ones that resonate with 
                you personally (Lecture 7). For instance, Shostakovitch was a Russian composer who often
                wrote pieces to express his opposition to the Soviet Union (source).
                
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, extrinsic motivators can be good to accomplish a task short-term, but not great for longer term tasks
                that might be more challenging and require more effort (a reading said this). Furthermore, this extrinsic mtivator 
                would likely need to be sustained every time you accomplish the task because if it stops, then you'll easily lose the motivation
                to do a task (doesn't this sound like <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">operant conditioning</a>?). If someone was always payed to 
                write compositions, this might lead them to be less motivated to write compositions "for fun" because as soon as they stop
                getting payed, there might be no reason to continue composing, especially if this is your career.  
                In this case performance may depend on how much money you get. Extrinsic motivators are also usually not things you can control. 
                You might have limited say on the pay you get for a composition, while you can (usually) choose what you want your composition is about 
                (link to choice section?).
