            <h1>Why do composers compose?</h1>

                <p>
                    Motivation is what drives us to begin and accomplish a task. If you are not motivated to compose, then why would
                    you spend any effort composing?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Motivation enables us to change our <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">behaviours</a> (Lecture 7). When we change these behaviours, 
                    we hope that we are better able to complete a certain task, which is a feeling that we'd like to reinforce (Lecture 3). This reinforcement should then in turn motivate
                    us to continue this behaviour, and thus, form this continuous feedback loop where motivation and behaviour influence each other. 
                    For instance, if a composition
                    teacher tells you that you need to stop giving the violins the melody all the time, if you are motivated enough to improve
                    your composition skills, you will change your piece and give the melody to another instrument. This might make your 
                    piece sound more interesting so you'll keep varying who has the melodies in your future pieces, demonstrating that you have
                    learned how to make a piece more interesting. 
                </p >
            <br>
            
            <h2>How are composers motivated?</h2>
                <p>
                    Motivators can be divided in two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "in" you (Lecture 7). Some examples of instrinsic motivators in the context of composition are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pure interest for composing</li>
                            <li>Learning or developping a new skill, such as <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity</a></li>
                            <li>Wanting to express ideas, <a href="../start/comp_strategies/emotion.html">emotions</a>, or a story</li>
                            <li>Raising awareness about a topic that is <a href="../motivation/identity.html">significant</a> to you</li>
                            <li>Becoming a better version of yourself - according to the humanist view on learning, learning can be a way 
                                to attain self-actualization, which is being able to master things that matter to us. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Extrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "outside" to you. Some examples of extrinsic motivators are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money or making a living out of composition</li>
                            <li>A deadline to submit a piece</li>
                            <li>Fame</li>
                            <li>Approval from society and demonstrating your self-worth and creativity to other people</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Determining whether a motivator is intrinsic or extrinsic is not always easy, especially since everyone is motivated by different things (Lecture 7).
                    For instance, receiving 
                    approval from others is listed as one of the extrinsic motivators above, but approval could also be somewhat intrinsic because I can
                    approve or disapprove of my own piece. When I enjoy listening to the pieces I create, then I am more motivated to
                    work on it.
                </p>

                <h2>Benefits of intrinsic motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    Intrinsic motivators are often better motivators to accomplish a task because those are the ones that personally resonate with 
                    you (Lecture 7). For instance, Shostakovitch was a Russian composer who was motivated to express the 
                    fear of living under the reign of Stalin in the mid 1900s or the struggles of Jewish people during WWII because these were 
                    struggles he had to face himself. He wished to share this struggle with those who were not able to freely express themselves under this regime (Civetta, C., 2018). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are more interested in the topic you learn, you will focus your attention on it and therefore, information will 
                    be better processed in working memory and put into long-term memory later on (see <a href="../start/comp_strategies/memory.html">here</a> for details on this mechanism).
                    These personal connections allow one to deeply
                    encode information you learn, so that it is easier to retreive at a later time (Lecture 4). On top of that, because you'll gain knowledge more easily due to this 
                    intrinsic motivation, 
                    this new knowledge might serve as even more motivation to learn the topic in more detail. Just like there is a feedback loop between behaviour
                    and motivation, there is also this constant back and forth
                    between motivation and these <a href="../learning/cognitivism.html">cognitive processes</a>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, extrinsic motivators can be good to accomplish a task short-term, but not great for longer term tasks
                    that might be more challenging and require more effort (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). Furthermore, this extrinsic motivator 
                    would likely need to be sustained every time you accomplish the task because if it stops, then you'll easily lose the motivation
                    to do a task. In this sense, extrinsic motivators are very similar to reinforcers in <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">operant conditioning</a>, 
                    since as soon as this extrinsic motivation no longers exist, you might stop performing the task alltogether. 
                    If someone was always payed to 
                    write compositions, this might lead them to be less motivated to write compositions "for fun" because as soon as they stop
                    getting payed, there might be no reason to continue composing, especially if this is your career.  
                    In this case, performance may also depend on how much money you get. It's as if the motivator needs to be given on a continuous reinforcement schedule, 
                    mearning that every time that we perform a certain action (such as composing music), we get rewarded for it in some way (for instance, with money) (Lecture 3). In this 
                    type of reinforcement schedule, one will not be likely to continue this action in absense of a reward. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Extrinsic motivators are also not usually things you can control because they are external to you. As mentioned <a href="../challenges/choices.html">here</a>,
                    our motivation increases when we have liberty to do things how we want in the task.  
                    You might have limited say on the pay you get for a composition, while you can (usually) choose the topic of a composition.
                </p>
