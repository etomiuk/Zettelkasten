        <p>What motivates composers to compose?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-efficacy</li>
            <li>Choice</li>
            <li>Goal setting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Motivation changes our behaviours (link to behaviourism) and our cognitive processes like attention and memory (link to cognitivism and its aspects)
        </p>
        <h2>Types of motivators</h2>
        <p>Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators: what applies to composition?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intrinsic: a motivator that is "in" you - leads to higher achievement because it is personal to you (Lecture 7)
                <li>Pure interest for composing</li>
                <li>Wanting to express ideas or emotions (link to emotion section)</li>
                <li>Raising awareness about a certain topic that matters to you</li>
            </li>
            <li>Extrinsic: a motivator that is outside to you - lessed linked to yourself and might be less controllable?
                <li>Money: making a living out of composition (honestly, probably not the strongest motivator because not payed much)
                    But getting payed to do a composition might motivate you to finish a composition because you have a deadline.
                </li>
                <li>Approval from society: you compose to show your self worth and creativity to other people
                </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Intrinsic motivators are often what motivate us more to accomplish a task. For instance, Shostakivitch was a Russion composer who often
            wrote pieces to express his opposition to the Soviet Union (source here). On the other hand, if someone was always payed to 
            write compositions, this might lead them to be less motivated to write compositions "for fun" because they are no longer getting 
            payed to do so (see operant conditioning/continuous reinforcement!). In this case performance may depend on how much money you get.
            ***there is also a link to choices***
