        <p>Why do composers compose?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-efficacy</li>
            <li>Choice</li>
            <li>Goal setting: link <a href="goals.html">here</a> (will be added to navbar soon)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Motivation changes our behaviours (link to behaviourism) and our cognitive processes like attention and memory (link to cognitivism and its aspects)
        </p>
        <h2>Types of motivators</h2>
        <p>Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators: what applies to composition?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intrinsic: a motivator that is "in" you - leads to higher achievement because it is personal to you (Lecture 7)
                <ul><li>Pure interest for composing (link to interest)</li>
                <li>Wanting to express ideas or emotions or story (link to emotion section)</li>
                <li>Raising awareness about a certain topic that matters to you</li></ul>
                I am not a very creative person so I don't always compose to express a storyline or an idea. I am someone who is very drawn to sound effects (depicting and separating sounds, combining sounds). I 
                have like ASMR/chills type responses when I listen to particular blends of sound that please me (it's a bit hard to explain).
                Thus an intrinsic motivator for me, other than interest, is the possibility of creating new and interesting combinations of sounds/melodies (I 
                know there's a better way to explain this...). If I like the melodies I create, I become more motivated to expand on my current 
                work and build on it (connection to conditioning - similar example)
                
            </li>
            <li>Extrinsic: a motivator that is outside to you - lessed linked to yourself and probably a bit less controllable (link to choice)
                <ul><li>Money: making a living out of composition (honestly, probably not the strongest motivator because not payed much)
                    But getting payed to do a composition might motivate you to finish a composition because you have a deadline.
                </li>
                <li>Fame: who wouldn't want to be as cool as John Williams?</li>
                <li>Approval from society: you compose to show your self worth and creativity to other people
                </li></ul>
                
                Approval is one extrinsic motivator that motivates me to continue pushing through a composition. If my piece is well
                recieved by someone, then I feel good about it and I'll be likely to continue composing (connect to self-efficacy). Approval could also be somewhat intrinsic
                because I can approve or disapprove of my own piece, which can motivate me as well.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Intrinsic motivators are often what motivate us more to accomplish a task. For instance, Shostakivitch was a Russion composer who often
            wrote pieces to express his opposition to the Soviet Union (source here). On the other hand, if someone was always payed to 
            write compositions, this might lead them to be less motivated to write compositions "for fun" because they are no longer getting 
            payed to do so (see operant conditioning/continuous reinforcement!). In this case performance may depend on how much money you get.
            ***there is also a link to choices***
