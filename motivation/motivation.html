        <h1>Why do composers compose?</h1>

            <p>
                *** motivation feedback loop motivatio -> behaviour -> consequence
                Motivation is what drives us to begin and accomplish a task. If you are not motivated to compose, then why would
                you spend any effort composing?
            </p>

            <p>
                Motivation enables us to change our <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">behaviours</a> (Lecture 7). For instance, if a composition
                teacher tells you that you need to stop giving the violins the melody all the time, if you are motivated enough to improve
                your composition skills, you will change your piece and give the melody to perhaps the cellos instead. You have changed your
                behaviour in your compositions, demonstrating that you have learned how to make a piece more interesting.
            </p >

            <p>
                Motivation also interacts with our <a href="../learning/cognitivism.html">cognitive processes</a> (Leccture 7). When you are motivated
                to learn something, you will focus your attention more on what you need to learn, and therefore, information will be more likely 
                to be better processed in working memory and put into long-term memory later on. Because the task or subect you are learning 
                is motivating, it will relate closer to your values and your interests. These personal connections make it easier to deeply
                encode information you learn, making it easier to retrive at a later time (Lecture 3?). On top of that, because you'll gain knowledge more easily, 
                this new knowledge might serve as even more motivation to learn the topic in more detail. There is this constant back and forth
                between motivation and these cognitive processes. 
            </p>

        <h2>How are composers motivated?</h2>
            <p>
                Motivators can be divided in two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Intrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "in" you. Some examples of instrinsic motivators in the context of composition:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pure <a href="../motivation/identity.html">interest</a> for composing</li>
                        <li>Learning or developping a new skill, such as <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">creativity</a></li>
                        <li>Wanting to express ideas, <a href="../comp_strategies/emotions.html">emotions</a>, or a story</li>
                        <li><a href="../motivation/goals.html">Raising awareness</a> about a topic that is 
                            <a href="../motivation/identity.html">significant</a> to you</li>
                    </ul>

                    I personally compose to develop my creativity. I am also very motivated and curious to see what kinds of sounds
                    combinations I can come up with to represent an idea. 
                </li>

                <li><b>Extrinsic motivator</b>: a motivator that is "outside" to you. Some examples of extrinsic motivators:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Money or making a living out of composition</li>
                        <li>A deadline to submit a piece</li>
                        <li>Fame (who wouldn't want to be as cool as John Williams?)</li>
                        <li>Approval from society and demonstrating your self-worth and creativity to other people</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    Approval is one extrinsic motivator that motivates me to continue pushing through a composition. If my piece is well
                    recieved by someone (for instance, by band teacher), then my <a href="../challenges/talent.html">self-efficacy</a>
                    improves and I'll be likely to continue composing because I'll be more confident that I can finish my piece. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Whether a motivator is intrinsic or extrinsic is not always clear-cut, especially since motivators are unique
                to everyone - not everyone is motivated by the same things. For instance, I mentioned above that receiving 
                approval from others is an extrinsic motivator for me, but approval could also be somewhat intrinsic because I can
                approve or disapprove of my own piece. When I enjoy listening to the pieces I create, then I am more motivated to
                continue working on it. I know that a certain section has been well written when I get the chills listening to it!
            </p>

            <p>
                Intrinsic motivators are often what motivate us more to accomplish a task because those are the ones that resonate with 
                you personally (Lecture 7). For instance, Shostakovitch was a Russian composer who wrote pieces to express the 
                fear of living under the reign of Stalin in the mid 1900s or the tragic struggles of Jewish people during WWII (Medium). 
                ***make the connection between deep processing and the connections in LTM, we learn better when we connect to things that matter, 
                to learn we need to be motivated and motivated by things that matter to us. 
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, extrinsic motivators can be good to accomplish a task short-term, but not great for longer term tasks
                that might be more challenging and require more effort (a reading said this). Furthermore, this extrinsic motivator 
                would likely need to be sustained every time you accomplish the task because if it stops, then you'll easily lose the motivation
                to do a task (doesn't this sound like <a href="../learning/behavourism.html">operant conditioning</a>?). If someone was always payed to 
                write compositions, this might lead them to be less motivated to write compositions "for fun" because as soon as they stop
                getting payed, there might be no reason to continue composing, especially if this is your career.  
                In this case performance may depend on how much money you get. Extrinsic motivators are also usually not things you can control. 
                You might have limited say on the pay you get for a composition, while you can (usually) choose what you want your composition is about 
                (link to choice section?).             
            </p>

            <p> 
                Motivators are like the rewards in operant conditioning. ***expand on this idea

            <h1>Learning Theories</h1>
            <h2>Humanism: composition as a way to fulfill your potential</h2>
                <p>
                    The humanist view of learning claims that the point of learning is to become better versions of ourselves 
                    (Lecture 7). In this view, learning should always be centered about fulfilling our potential and goals 
                    (link to goals here). This is described in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where the top of this pyramid is
                    self-actualization. Maslow's pyramid implies that we should strive to attain self-actualization, which is 
                    being able to master something that matters to us.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Link to composition: do composers try to become better versions of themselves through composition? Relate to mastery goal (link)
                </p>

                <p>*** maybe put this in why learn to compose section instead?</p>
