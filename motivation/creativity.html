            <p>
                Composition can be a great way to improve creativity. This is one of the personal reasons why I compose - it is my
                <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">intrinsic motivation</a>, because I don't consider myself to be creative and it is 
                something I'd like to improve. I feel like there is always this pressure that 
                composers need to be creative to stand out, so in a way, improving creativity can also be an <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic motivator</a>
                if we are 
                looking to improve creativity for the sake of pleasing other people with your compositions. 
                To be creative, one of the components is to have this intrinsic motivation (Lecture 9).  
            </p>

            <p> *** should I talk about the other creativity components?</p>

            <p>
                Having choices can increase our motivation to execute a task (Lecture 8). This is because we are allowed to have the option to
                make this task more meaningful to ourselves. Limiting creativity might negatively impact a composer's work because it doesn't 
                allow them to use all the "tools" and techniques they want to express their ideas. For instance, during the pandemic, my high school
                would split music classes in small groups to not have too many students (who are all playing wind instruments) in the same room. 
                It ended up such that one of her classes only contained 3 students so they could not play a piece meant for band, so my music 
                teacher asked me to compose a short piece for these three students who played trumpet, trombone, and electric bass.
                My creativity while writing this piece was limited in several ways:

                <ul>
                    <li>My motivation was <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic</a>. I wanted to please my teacher and write something
                        that she would approve of as well as something that I thought the students would enjoy playing. I was not writing something for myself.
                    </li>

                    <li>I had a fixed set of instruments to work with. This means I also have a limited set of sounds I can use as well. 
                        I was challenged with how to include an electric bass with two brass instruments. I would have naturally never picked 
                        to include an electric bass with two brass instruments, one of them already being a lower register instrument.
                    </li>

                    <li>I had to consider the musical capacities of the students: they were high school students with little musical training
                        other from what they learn in class. That meant that I was limited in the complexity of the music I wrote and even the notes
                        that I use (for instance, high notes are hard to reach on brass instruments so it's better not to write a lot of them). 
                        The piece needed to also be short or else the students get tired and lose their attention.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Although I was motivated to write this piece because it presented some new challenges, the lack of choices I had made it 
                difficult to write and it was hard to find inspiration to write a piece with all these constraints because I had many other 
                ideas that I could not use in this particular piece.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, having too many choices can be harmful, especially if you're not an expert (connect to expertise), because you don't have the necessary knowledge
                to know what composition techniques to use, or what instruments to use. A beginner composer would likely feel overwhelmed if 
                they had to write a piece for symphonic orchestra because of all the instruments they can chose to write for! (I think composition
                classes probably have you start off with simple melodies on a single insrtument to limit your choices at first, and as you learn, 
                you have more liberty in what you write) --> increase in cognitive load due to decision paralysis.
