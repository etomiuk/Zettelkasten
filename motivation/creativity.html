        <p style="color:red;">
            Composition can be a great way to improve creativity. This is one of the personal reasons why I compose - it is my
            intrinsic motivation, because I don't consider myself to be creative. I feel like there is always this pressure that 
            we need to be creative to stand out, so in a way, improving creativituy can also be an extrinsic motivator if we are 
            looking to improve creativity for the sake of pleasing other people with your compositions. 
            To be creative, one of the components is to have this intrinsic motivation (Lecture 9).  
        </p>

        <p>
            Having choices can increase our motivation do execute a task (Leture 8). This is because we are allowed to have the option to
            make this task more meaningful to ourselves. Limiting creativity might negatively impact a composer's work because it doesn't 
            allow them to use all the "tools" and techniques they want to express their ideas. For instance, I was asked by my
            band teacher to compose a short piece for 3 students playing the trumpet, trombone, and electric bass during the pandemic
            because high school music classes were smaller so it was impossible for them to play a band piece. I was limited in several
            ways:
            <ul>
                <li>My motivation was extrinsic (link to extrinsic motivation): I wanted to please my teacher and write something
                    that she would approve of. I was not writing something for myself.
                </li>
                <li>I had a fixed set of instruments I needed to write for. I was challenged with how to include an electric bass
                    with two brass instruments. I would have not naturally written for this kind of trio.
                </li>
                <li>I had to consider the musical capacities of the students: they were high school students with little musical training
                    apart from what they learn in class. That meant that I was limited in the complexity of the music I wrote and even the notes
                    that I use (for instance, high notes are hard to reach on brass instruments). The piece needed to also be short or else the 
                    students get tired.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Although I was motivated to write this piece because it presented some new challenges, the lack of choices I had made it 
            difficult to write and it was hard to find inspiration to write a piece with all these constraints because I had many other 
            ideas that I could not use in this particular piece.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, having too many choices can be harmful, especially if you're not an expert (connect to expertise), because you don't have the necessary knowledge
            to know what composition techniques to use, or what instruments to use. A beginner composer would likely feel overwhelmed if 
            they had to write a piece for symphonic orchestra because of all the instruments they can chose to write for! (I think composition
            classes probably have you start off with simple melodies on a single insrtument to limit your choices at first, and as you learn, 
            you have more liberty in what you write) --> increase in cognitive load due to decision paralysis.
