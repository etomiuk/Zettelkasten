        <h1>Developing new skills</h1>

            <p>
                Composition can be a great way to improve various skills, such as creativity or musical skills.
                This is one of the personal reasons why I compose - it is my
                <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">intrinsic motivation</a>, because I don't consider myself to be creative
                and it is something I'd like to improve. In this sense, acquiring a new skill can be a mastery goal because your 
                goal in learning a new task is to simply to become better at something for your own self-satisfaction. To 
                be creative, you need to be intrinsically motivated (Lecture 9).
            </p>

            <p>
                I feel like there is always this pressure that composers need to be 
                creative to stand out, so in a way, improving creativity can also be an <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic motivator</a>
                if we are looking to improve creativity for the sake of pleasing other people with your compositions.
                If to goal of becoming more creative through composing is to impress other people and be better than another composer,
                then this would be more of a performance goal. There are two types of performance goals:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Approach-based goal</b>: The goal is to make you look better than someone else. In the context of composition, 
                    you would composer to outperform some other composer with your ideas.</li>
                    <li><b>Avoidance-based goal</b>: The goal is to avoid looking bad. In composition, this can be shown by the fact that 
                    you don't want to look unoriginal and incompetent in front of other people so you work hard to improve your creativity.</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>


        <h2>Developping skills in other areas</h2>

            <p> 
                These skills might not only be useful to composition: they might be transferrable to other areas. Sometimes, 
                this knowledge can help us learn a new task easily, which is called a positive transfer, and sometimes, it can even hinder
                and interfere with our learning, which is a negative transfer (Lecture 9). If our previous knowledge and skills are related 
                to the new task we are learning, this is called a near transfer, since 
                the transfer of knowledge and learning can easily connect. This type of transfer is a lot easier to do compared to a far transfer, 
                where we are transferring knowledge from a very different domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is widely known that music has benefits for your health (Kubicek, L., 2022). Therefore, one might be motivated to learn composition
                to use it as a tool to improve their mental health and help cope with other problems. This would be an example of a far transfer of knowledge.
                This is why music therapy exists and is effective. In particular, composition can help teach people to express their emotions or 
                experiences for those who might not be able to share them verbally or those who have difficulties or fears expressing their thoughts
                (Canadian Association of Music Therapists).
