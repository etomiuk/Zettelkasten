        <h1>Creativity in composition</h1>

            <p>
                Composition can be a great way to improve creativity. This is one of the personal reasons why I compose - it is my
                <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">intrinsic motivation</a>, because I don't consider myself to be creative
                and it is something I'd like to improve. In this sense, acquiring a new skill can be a mastery goal because your 
                goal in learning a new task is to simply to become better at something. In fact, to 
                be creative, you need to be intrinsically motivated (Lecture 9).
            </p>

            <p>
                I feel like there is always this pressure that composers need to be 
                creative to stand out, so in a way, improving creativity can also be an <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">extrinsic motivator</a>
                if we are looking to improve creativity for the sake of pleasing other people with your compositions.
                If to goal of becoming more creative through composing is to impress other people and be better than another composer,
                then this would be more of a performance goal. There are two types of performance goals:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Approach-based goal</b>: The goal is to make you look better than someone else. In the context of composition, 
                    you would composer to outperform some other composer with your ideas.</li>
                    <li><b>Avoidance-based goal</b>: The goal is to avoid looking bad. In composition, this can be shown by the fact that 
                    you don't want to look unoriginal and incompetent in front of other people so you work hard to improve your creativity.</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a lot of other skills one can acquire through composition: musical skills, music theory, editing/publishing skills, etc. 
            </p>

            
            <p> *** should I talk about the other creativity components?</p>
            <p>*** Make sure to connect this back to the main theme of "why do we compose"</p>
