        <h1>Interest in composition</h1>

        <p>
            Obviously, one would compose if they were interested in it. If not there would not be a point! Interest plays a huge 
            role in the choices (link to choice) a composer makes and how motivated they are to pursue their composition. A composer
            asked to write a piece depicting life on a farm (very random example...) might not be motivated to write a composition about
            that if they are not interested in studying such lifestyle. This might be ven harder if the composer has never experienced (link
            to experience) life on a farm. Therefore, a composer might lack motivation to write this piece. This can apply to all aspects of composition, 
            such as instrumentation, topic, musical textures, etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My personal classical musical interests lie in Romantic music, music with expressive emotions and drama. I am also a huge
            fan of movie music (as you might notice from the musical exerpts in this site). Although it is fun to experiment a little, I rarely compose baroque-sounding music, or modern/minimalist music, 
            because these styles are not very interesting to me. I don't listen and enjoy (or even like to perform) these types of classical music.
            I've heard that McGill's composition program is very oriented towards modern composition techniques. This is great news for those 
            interested in this style, but this might push away students who wish to study composition at McGill, but who don't wish to 
            be expected to write music like that (see choice).
        </p>

            ***note for Emma: think of a musical example to put here? maybe one of my more classical sounding pieces and show that it is unfinished 
            because not motivated, no inspiration... (also hoping my planets thing is semi-modern but very unfinished since 2019)
