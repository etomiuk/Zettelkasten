        <h1>What are some goals composers might set?</h1>
        <p>Composers might have many goals that motivate them to compose music. These goals can be found at many scales. 
        </p>

        <h2>Large scale goals: what do they want to achieve from the composition?</h2>
            <p>
                Very tied to motivation - what is motivating them. Goals can relate to making an audience feel something, inform, 
                simply experiment, a composition to played somewhere by an orchestra. 
                ***add some personal goals I've had and talk about the forced goals of the PP and how it might not be useful because
                we HAD to create them so that they fit with the IB (thus limiting our choices) 
            </p>
            
        <h2>Small scale goals: what are some steps needed to achieve the larger goals?</h2>
            <p>
                These can involve daily goals in writing, like: Today I want to complete that flute line I started, or today I want
                to think about well well my dynamic contrast is achieved. 
            </p>
        
        <p> we can realize much of these goals are mastery goals. Is composition competitive? Are we really comparing ourselves 
            against others? Somewhat yes if we compare our music to the great composers, but also awknowledge that we have our own
            style as well. 
        </p>
