        <h1>Composition as part of an identity</h1>

        <p>
            As much as composition is quite social (link to social), it can also be a very introspective and personal form of art. 
            Composers might express very deep emotions (connect to emotion section), anxieties, fears, dreams they have through composition which gives a listener 
            insight on perhaps a composer's personal life as well as their values and culture (link to culture). 
        </p>

        <p>
            A composer might see music as the outlet to express these ideas and emotions. Because this reason to oomposer is 
            very personal, this can easily motivate and inspire composers to write (connection to motivation ---plz fix this sentence). 
        </p>

        <h2>Long-lasting impact of a composition</h2>
        <p>
            Like most art forms, the artist becomes associated with their art. In visual arts, we see a work belongs to someone
            by the signature. In composition, we see the name of the composer on the music sheet. In this sense, a composition 
            becomes associated to a composer's identity forever. We know a composer through their works and their personal style.
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that I wonder about is if there is ever any kind of inherent bias when we see a composer's name on a piece, particularly
            if the composer is unknown (don't know the quality of their pieces) - this idea comes from those articles that show those AIs 
            that classify CVs have inherent bias towards white-sounding names and tend to reject more black sounding names (https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/08/18/name-discrimination-jobs).
            For instance, female composers are rare. Would we judge a female's piece to be less good than a male composer's piece (and why?).  
            I find it weird to see my own name on one of my compositions, as if it was already published... maybe because my name doesn't 
            fit the standard classical composer's names (white european men)? Perhaps this is the real reason why I usually write E. Tomiuk
            as the composer name rather than my full name?

        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>
            Obviously, one would compose if they were interested in it. If not there would not be a point! Interest plays a huge 
            role in the choices (link to choice) a composer makes and how motivated they are to pursue their composition. A composer
            asked to write a piece depicting life on a farm (very random example...) might not be motivated to write a composition about
            that if they are not interested in studying such lifestyle. This might be ven harder if the composer has never experienced (link
            to experience) life on a farm. Therefore, a composer might lack motivation to write this piece. This can apply to all aspects of composition, 
            such as instrumentation, topic, musical textures, etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My personal classical musical interests lie in Romantic music, music with expressive emotions and drama. I am also a huge
            fan of movie music (as you might notice from the musical exerpts in this site). Although it is fun to experiment a little, I rarely compose baroque-sounding music, or modern/minimalist music, 
            because these styles are not very interesting to me. I don't listen and enjoy (or even like to perform) these types of classical music.
            I've heard that McGill's composition program is very oriented towards modern composition techniques. This is great news for those 
            interested in this style, but this might push away students who wish to study composition at McGill, but who don't wish to 
            be expected to write music like that (see choice).
        </p>
        <p>
            ***\think of a musical example to put here? maybe one of my more classical sounding pieces and show that it is unfinished 
            because not motivated, no inspiration... (also hoping my planets thing is semi-modern but very unfinished since 2019)
