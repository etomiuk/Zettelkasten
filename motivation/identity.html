        <h1>Composition as part of an identity</h1>

            <p>
                As much as composition is quite <a href="../experience/social.html">social</a>, it can also be a very introspective 
                and personal form of art. Composers might express very deep <a href="../comp_strategies/emotions.html">emotions</a>,
                anxieties, fears, or dreams through composition which gives a listener insight on a composer's personal life as well
                as their values and <a href="./experiences/culture.html">culture</a>. A composer might feel that music is the only way
                to express their ideas and emotions, which is in itself an <a href="../motivation.html">intrinsic motivator</a> for 
                someone to begin composing a piece.
                Because you can become so associated with your work, it is pretty easy for a composer's self-efficacy to take a hard blow 
                when their piece gets criticized. These challenges are discussed more in detail <a href="../challenges/criticism.html">here</a>.
            </p>

        <h2>Long-lasting impacts of a composition</h2>

            <p>
                Like most art forms, a composer becomes associated with their pieces. In visual arts,
                a signature is a way of "claiming" 
                that a work if yours. In composition, usually the name of the composer appears at the top of the music sheet. In this
                sense, a composition becomes associated to a composer's identity forever. We get to know a composer through their works
                and their personal style.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing that I wonder is whether there is ever any kind of inherent bias when we see a composer's name on a piece,
                particularly if we are not familiar with the composer, just like some recruiters might have some preconceived beliefs about
                a job applicant just by seeing their name (Young, R. & McMahon, S. 2021).
                Would we judge a female's piece, or a piece written by a Black classical composer to be less good than a white male composer's
                piece just because historically, composition was a white male-dominated domain?  
            </p>

            <p>
                I personally find it weird to see my own name on one of my compositions, as if it was already published. Maybe 
                because my name doesn't fit the standard classical composer's names (white european men)? Perhaps this is the real
                reason why I usually write my initials as the composer name rather than my full name...
            </p>

        <h2>AI and Identity</h2>
            <p>
                The rise of new and more powerful AIs is leading towards more discussion about its impact on the arts. If an AI helps you
                compose a piece, is it really YOUR piece anymore? Just like it is becoming harder for us to distinguish human text from AI
                text, will we also reach this point with music (Rahman, M. M. & Watanobe, Y. 2023)? One can argue that classical music is way
                too complex for an AI to replicate because it involves so many human factors such as emotion or expressing a personal identity 
                (Brodeur, M. A. 2023). A piece of music is more than just the notes we hear: it also involves a story and a whole process
                behind the composition which is something AI might not be able to use. 

            <p>
                AI is also only has good as the inputs you give it (Lecture 11). This can mean that the output of the AI depends on how 
                good the inputs you give it are. Therefore, perhaps the achievements of AI can be dedicated to the person giving 
                the inputs. 
            </p>
