        <!--Introduction-->
        <p> I am a self-taught classical composer. I am also passionate about
            learning how we learn. How do these two topics relate to each other?
            Read on to find out!
        </p>

        <!--Topic from lecture 1 discussions-->
        <h2>What is learning?</h2>
        <p>Learning is change (lecture 2). The change can be visible (like a change or acquisition of new behaviour), a view that is adopted by the <a href="behaviourism.html">behaviourists</a>,
            or it can be invisible (like a gaining knowledge about a topic), which would align with <a href="cognitivism.html">cognitivists</a>.
            This change can be seen in many ways. In my experience composing, I can track my learning and improvement in my compositions by comparing the 
            complexity of my previous works with my current ones. This can be complexity in terms of how detailed the melody or accompaniement are, 
            what kinds of effects I am able to create, the complexity of the rhythms, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I don't have my very first (and terrible) orchestral compositions, so 
            below is a snippet of a piano melody I came up with in high school. It is quite simple since the accompaniment
            is exactly the same throughout all the measures, and there aren't any tonality or dynamic contrasts.
        </p>

        </audio>

        <p>In comparison, this is a part of a piece I wrote two years ago. The accompaniment is much more complex since, there is some kind
            of upwards progression in the first notes of each slurred group of triplets. I have also learnt the importance of 
            articulations, dynamic and expression markings which help me convey emotions more effectivelt. In this sense, it shows that throughout many years, 
            I have learnt different aspects of composing that are essential to conveying my ideas to to creating expressive music.

        <p>Learning depends on the experiences we live (lecture 2). One's style of composition
            is often influenced by an experience, another inspiring composer, or the music we listen to. Style might also be influenced
            by your composition teacher (see <a href="#social">learing as a social experience</a>).
            One can learn patterns or textures in music by listening and analyzing pieces they enjoy. Although I like
            to experiment, my personal style is probably similar to the late-romantic era of classical music.
            I am inspired and learn from composers such as Dvorak, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and I try to create large dramatic
            effects using a large orchestra. I learn how to capture emotions or a story through music by seeing how these composer do it. I also
            tend to follow similar structures of music that were popular in that time. For instance, many composers wrote Scherzo's in a specific form: 
            start with a theme, then a secondary theme (usually repeated twice), return to the main theme (these form section A), then a completely new section usually called "trio" (section B),
            then repeat section A all over again with an optional coda or conclusion (Wikipedia). I have used the exact same structure when writing Scherzo-like pieces as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Implicit Learning</h3>
        <p>Learning might happen when we are know really aware of it. This is called implicit learning. This is when we pay little <a href="attention.html">attention</a> to the things we are learning (Lecture 5).
            As we listen to music, we implicitly learn about features of that music. These features might become <a href="knowledge.html">implicit knowledge</a> because we might not be aware that we have this knowledge.
            An example of such knowledge would be scale systems, which are discussed in more detail <a href="knowledge.html">here</a>.</p>
