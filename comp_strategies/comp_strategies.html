        <h1>Composition strategies</h1>
        
        <p>
            Composition techniques stem from the great classical composers. (heavily relates to culture section)
            - culture = transmission of knowledge/learning to many generations - in a way, composition is like a culture (source: culture reading from last week)
            - following western traditions of composition
            - classical composition treatises
        </p>

        <p>
            Creativity in a domain requires prior knowledge in that domain (Lecture 9). How can one be creative with music if they know
            nothing about music? One needs to know at least something about how music works, e.g. what different instruments sound like, how 
            to read notes on a staff, how to write certain rhythms, etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Creativity is often what makes a composer "better" and better known. Composers need to be innovative. If one person writes the 
            exact kinds of pieces as Bach, would there be any motivation to go listen to that new composer over listening to pieces that already 
            exist from Bach? (Not sure about this paragraph...). 
        </p>

        <p>
            As I write this, it is quite difficult to pinpoint what is a creative composition - there are so many aspects that make a composition creative.
            I think that a composition is seen as 
            creative when it includes elements that have never been seen before, such as using new combinations of instruments to create 
            a unique sound, using a unique combination of rhythm, writing a melody that stands out from others (whatever that might mean), or 
            having a unique storyline to a piece.
            It is possible that everyone has a different definition of creative. My orchestra conductor tells us about how some components
            of the pieces we play are creative because some aspect was something that was rarely done in the time the composition was written.
            
            One of my favourite classical pieces of all time is Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Rite of Spring has the reputation of being really chaotic
            and dissonant, but I think this is what is so creative about it. There is a section of the piece where there must be at least 
            6 different melodies happening at the same time, which sounds very chaotic, but this is able to convey the story of the Rite of Spring (I'll spare the details, the story is pretty depressing and gruesome...).
            He also writes this piece for unusually large orchestra (e.g. he basically doubles the number of instruments of the typical orchestra and adds
            some funky ones like the alto flute or the bass trumpet), which adds to the chaos, as well as the unique sounds he is able to create.
            (***maybe cut this down, I got too excited about this...)

            *** include image of the chaos
        </p>

        <p>
            All this to say that in my opinion, composition strategies are like the prior knowledge needed to be creative with a piece. 
            It is a starting point for one's work, the toolbox needed to learn to compose. Composers need to add their personal flair
            in order to stand out from the crowd rather than just copying other people (more on copying others in the social section).
        </p>
