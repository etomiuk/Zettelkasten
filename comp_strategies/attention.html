        <h1>Capturing a listener's attention through music</h1>
            <p>
                Attention is critical in learning because it allows us to focus on a specific stimuli. By paying attention to certain
                stimuli, this information is able to enter working memory to be worked with and processed and then it can be eventually 
                stored in long-term memory. Composers exploit features of our attention to create interesting music. Some stimuli
                that naturally capture attention have the following properties:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intensity:</b> Loud sounds will catch attention. When I think about this one, I always think of one time
                        in orchestra, we played Stravinski's Firebird suite, where there is a slow and soft movement followed by a
                        very loud and intense movement. I wasn't playing at the end of the slow movement and rehearsal was getting
                        long so I was starting to lose focus. When we began the next movement, my reaction almost looked like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnMv6-XTROY">this</a>.
                        The loud bang definitely caught that audience member's attention for the rest of the piece!

                        <p>
                            Also, some instruments are naturally louder than others. Composers will play around with dynamics and
                            with which instruments play with which and how many instruments will play at the same time to direct a
                            listener's attention. Another fun example of how composers easily use loudness to capture attention is
                            in Hayden's "Surprise Symphony".
                        </p>

                        Taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLjwkamp3lI
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Novelty:</b> To make their pieces interesting, composers often introduce new themes, musical ideas, and
                        melodies in their pieces. They also experiment with new combinations of instruments to create new textures
                        or create new rhythms to add variety. Or else, if the piece just repeated the same melody in the same way,
                        it would be so boring! Beethoven's 2nd movement of his 7th symphony uses a recurring theme throughout the 
                        entire movement that is repeated over and over again. Yet, it is not boring. The piece starts off with the melody 
                        in the lower strings:

                        ***insert beethoven 7th 2 opening

                        The melody is then embellished with  variations in the accompaniement as well as different instruments:
                        ***insert the theme with the violin thing and flutes with melody

                        It is also repeated in different dynamic contrasts
                        ***insert the theme but loud       
                        
                        It is also modified in a different key 
                        ***insert theme in major
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Emotions:</b> Music often represents strong emotions. Classical composers (especially in the Romantic era)
                        are really skilled at eliciting emotions from their music. Emotions capture our attention because they might 
                        remind us of a personal event or feeling: they activate certain memories that are deeply encoded by emotion.
                        Respighi's introduction for the Pines of Rome is very joyful and full of energy - how could you not smile When
                        listening to this intro? 

                        ***insert Pines of Rome intro
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Personal preference:</b> Music that we like will capture our attention more and will probably be more
                        <a href="../comp_strategies/memory.html">memorable</a>. *** connect this to interest and motivation! I personally
                        really like dark music in minor keys (I promise I am ok!) so music like this will capture my attention and curiosity
                        and will entice me to continue to listen to it:
                    
                        ***insert end of Shostakovitch symphony 5 end of mvt 1
                    
                        But this music might not capture your attention if that's not the kind of music you're into. In that sense, 
                        it is hard to please the entire audience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Choose your own adventure... but with music!</h2>
            <p>
                One thing that is really cool about music is that we can also choose to direct our attention to specific components
                of a piece. Classical composers might write several melodies at once and you can discover them by directing your 
                attention to a specific instrument for example. When writing music, there is often a melody and an accompaniment. 
                The melody is what we usually pay attention to and the accompaniment is what supports and embellishes the melody. 
                However, one can choose to pay attention to the acccompaniment as well. Music is like a "melodic cocktail party"
                because there are often many melodies happening at the same time, and we can choose what we listen to (McAdams, 2022).
            </p>

            <p>
                A piece I recently composed for band exploits the fact that there are different melodies one can listen to and I
                humbly think that this excerpt is a really cool example of the fact that you can choose which melody you want to 
                hear. I combine four different melodies which all work together. Try to direct your attention to each of these 
                melodies to discover them! If you can read music notation, you can follow the score to make it easier (though 
                melody 4 is a bit harder to hear).
            </p>

            <p>
                The primacy and recency effect explain why we remember certain types of information. The primacy effect says that we remember information that is presented first because it's 
                the first thing we pay attention to and we have more time to process it, while the recency effect says that we remember the last thing that is presented to us because it is what
                is freshest on our minds. For this reason, I think that a good composition needs a good introduction and conclusion. That way, the introction captures a listener's 
                attention right away, and the conclusion will also be one of the last things they will remember of a piece. 
            </p>

            <h2>Implicit knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    Implicit knowledge is knowledge that can't necessarily be articulated because you aren't aware that it's there. We
                    might gain this knowledge through <a href="index.html#implicit_learning">implicit learning</a>, just by existing essentially.
                </p>

                <p>
                    *** should this example be in culture section????
                    An example in music are different scales that are used in different cultures (scales form the world site). When living within a certain culture, 
                    you are likely to listen to that culture's music. Their style and features might become implicit knowledge because you are not necessarily 
                    trying to learn what the patterns of the scales are (unless you are a music theorist). These might be reflected in the type of music a composer writes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another example might be the fact that major chords usually represent happiness and minor chords represent sadness. We know this fact, but we 
                    don't know why this is (*** research on this: neuroscientists are still unsure why - it might be innate, or something we implicitly learnt from the environment).
