        <h1>Attention</h1>
            <p>
                Attention is critical in learning because it allows us to focus on a specific stimuli. Composers exploit features of our attention to create interesting music.
                Some stimuli naturally capture attention have the following properties:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intensity:</b> Loud sounds will catch attention. When I think about this one, I always think of one time in orchestra, we played Stravinski's Firebird suite, and 
                        there is a slow and soft movement followed by a very loud and intense movement. I wasn't playing at the end of the slow movement and rehearsal was getting long 
                        so I was starting to lose focus. When we began the next movement, my reaction almost looked like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnMv6-XTROY">this</a>. We can say
                        that I definitely started paying attention after that!

                        <p>Also, some instruments are naturally louder than others. Composers will play around with dynamics and with which instruments play with which and how many instruments will 
                        play at the same time to direct a listener's attention. Another fun example of how composers easily use loudness to capture attention is in Hayden's "Surprise Symphony".
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Novelty:</b> To make their pieces interesting, composers often introduce new themes, musical ideas, and melodies in their pieces. They also experiment with new combinations of 
                        instruments to create new textures or create new rhythms to add variety. Or else, if the piece just repeated the same melody in the same way, it would be so boring!
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Emotions:</b> Music often represents strong emotions. Classical composers (especially in the Romantic era) are really skilled at eliciting emotions from their music.</li>
                    <li><b>Personal preference:</b> Music that we like will capture our attention more and will probably be more <a href="#memory">memorable</a>. *** connect this to interest and motivation!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing that is really cool about music is that we can also choose to direct our attention to specific components of a piece. Classical composers might write several melodies
                at once and you can discover them by directing your attention to a specific instrument for example. When writing music, there is often a melody and an accompaniment. The melody is what we
                usually pay attention to and the accompaniment is what supports and embellishes the melody. However, one can choose to pay attention to the acccompaniment as well. Music is like a "melodic
                cocktail party" because there are often many melodies happening at the same time, and we can choose what we listen to (McAdams, 2022).
            </p>

            <p>
                A piece I recently composed for band exploits the fact that there are different melodies one can listen to and I humbly think that 
                this excerpt is a really cool example of the fact that you can choose which melody you want to hear. I combine four different melodies which all work together. Try to direct your attention 
                to each of these melodies to discover them! If you can read music notation, you can follow the score to make it easier (though melody 4 is a bit harder to hear).

            <p>
                The primacy and recency effect explain why we remember certain types of information. The primacy effect says that we remember information that is presented first because it's 
                the first thing we pay attention to and we have more time to process it, while the recency effect says that we remember the last thing that is presented to us because it is what
                is freshest on our minds. For this reason, I think that a good composition needs a good introduction and conclusion. That way, the introction captures a listener's 
                attention right away, and the conclusion will also be one of the last things they will remember of a piece. 
            </p>

            <h2>Implicit knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    Implicit knowledge is knowledge that can't necessarily be articulated because you aren't aware that it's there. We
                    might gain this knowledge through <a href="index.html#implicit_learning">implicit learning</a>, just by existing essentially.
                </p>

                <p>
                    *** should this example be in culture section????
                    An example in music are different scales that are used in different cultures (scales form the world site). When living within a certain culture, 
                    you are likely to listen to that culture's music. Their style and features might become implicit knowledge because you are not necessarily 
                    trying to learn what the patterns of the scales are (unless you are a music theorist). These might be reflected in the type of music a composer writes.
                </p>

                    Another example might be the fact that major chords usually represent happiness and minor chords represent sadness. We know this fact, but we 
                    don't know why this is (*** research on this: neuroscientists are still unsure why - it might be innate, or something we implicitly learnt from the environment).
