        <h1>How do we learn to compose?</h1>
            <h2>Behaviourism: composition as a way of showing improvement</h2>
                <p>
                    According to a behaviourist, one has learned when they display correct behaviour (Lecture 2). This behaviour
                    must be observable, so therefore, cannot depend on our <a href="./cognitivism.html">mental processes</a> such
                    as reasoning and memory (Lecture 3). Composers can show that they have learnt through the pieces they write: 
                    they can easily display a new behaviour by applying a new composition technique and by showing how their piece
                    sounded better than before. ***maybe give an example of one of my pieces, a before and after
                </p>

                <p>
                    *** this sentence might be removed if the connection here is too awkward.
                    For behaviourists, the mechanisms through which one learns is through conditioning. They define two types of 
                    conditioning: classical conditioning and operant conditioning.
                </p>

            <h3>Criticism</h3>
                <p>
                    Behaviourism cannot explain entirely explain how one learns to compose. Oftentimes, I am inspired by 
                    <a href="../expereince/modelling.html">other composers </a> and the way they use certain instruments or chords 
                    to create textures and effects, and I don't need a reward or punishment to change my behaviour. Learning to
                    compose also requires using knowledge and <a href="../comp_strategies/ltm.html">memory</a> to learn these patterns
                    (see <a href="./cognitivism.html">cognitivism</a>), which would go against behaviourist views that learning 
                    is purely visible. 
                </p>
