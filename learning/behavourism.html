            <h1>Behaviourism: learning is a change in behaviour</h1>
                <p>
                    According to behaviourism, one has learned when they display correct behaviour (Lecture 3). This behaviour
                    must be observable, so therefore, cannot depend on our <a href="./cognitivism.html">mental processes</a> like
                    reasoning and memory (Lecture 4). Composers can show that they have learnt through the pieces they write. 
                    They can easily display a new behaviour by applying a new composition technique and comparing how the piece sounded
                    before and after this change. In the pieces I compared <a href="./learning.html">here</a>, we can clearly see an 
                    improvement in how I write pieces for piano.

                </p>

                <p>
                    How does one learn to change their behaviour? Behaviourists propose two mechanisms: classical and operant conditioning. 
                </p>
            <h2>Classical conditioning: generating emotions</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of classical conditioning is to elicit a certain behaviour, called conditioned response, in response to a certain
                    stimulus, called conditioned stimulus (Lecture 3). The way this is done is that we continuously pair a stimulus that naturally produces
                    the desired behaviour (called unconditioned response) with the stimulus we'd like to cause the behaviour (a neutral stimulus)
                    until the neutral stimulus generates the conditioned response, at which point it becomes the conditioned stimulus. Classical 
                    conditioning can explain how we have certain emotional reactions to specific kinds of music, and movie music composers take advantage of 
                    this to learn to <a href="../start/comp_strategies/emotion.html">generate strong emotions</a> in their listeners.
                </p>

            <h2>Operant conditioning: learning through a composer's emotions</h2>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, operant conditioning relies on how behaviour changes after someone has received a consequence.
                    This theory is based on the idea that we can change behaviour if we provide rewards or punishments
                    after a behaviour is elicited (Lecture 3). A lot of our learning is connected to our emotions, so reinforcements
                    could be positive emotions such as happiness, pride, excitement, whereas punishments can be
                    negative emotions we wish to suppress, like anger, sadness, or fear.
                    In this sense, the sound of certain notes or chords could act like 
                    a stimulus that causes reinforcement or punishment. Also, someone's reaction to your piece can also serve as a reinforcer. 
                    If someone likes your piece, they will give good feedback (positive reinforcement), so you are more likely to repeat the 
                    things you used to compose that piece. 
                </p>

                <div class="text-video-div">
                    <p>
                    In my experience, as a self-taught composer who has little 
                    theoretical background on music, I depend a lot on experimentation to figure out the kind 
                    of sound I am looking for. When certain chords or melodies sound bad, I am less likely to
                    use those chords. These nasty feeling I get when listening to my bad chords or melodies can be like a positive punishment, since 
                    I will never want to use that chord progression or melody again because I feel feelings I do not enjoy. An example from my own work
                    is the following accompaniment to a nice bassoon melody I came up with this summer, in which I personally think 
                    that the D# in the violas sounds awkward and muddy. Therefore, because this sounds bad, 
                    I will be less likely to produce music that sounds like this to avoid having to hear music like this again.
                    </p>

                </div>
                

                <p>
                    On the other hand, certain effects I think sound good tend to appear a lot in my pieces.
                    For instance, I tend to write a certain rhythmic pattern quite often in my pieces because I enjoy the feeling of the offbeats
                    that is created with that rhythm. The chills I get when I listen to 
                    their sound is like a positive reinforcement that makes me more likely to use them in my pieces. Here are some excerpts that use
                    these rhythms (highlighted in red).

            <p>
                Behaviourism cannot entirely explain how one learns to compose because learning often also involves processes that may not
                be visible, such as forming <a href="./cognitivism.html">deep connections</a> between real life experiences and the content we try to learn
                (Lecture 5). Oftentimes, I am inspired by 
                <a href="../experience/social/modelling.html">other composers </a> and the way they use certain instruments or chords 
                to create textures and effects so I learn from others without necessarily being rewarded or punished. Furthermore, other things, 
                such as <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivation</a> can cause changes in visible behaviour, without having the need to add or remove
                some kind of stimulus after a certain behaviour occurs. However, the consequences that follow a behaviour can then have an influence
                on our motivation which can help strengthen or weaken this behaviour afterwards in this feedback loop, as described 
                <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">here</a>.
