        <h1>How do we learn to compose?</h1>
            <h2>Social Cognitivism: composing as a social activity</h2>
                <p>
                    How does the environment and the people around us influence our learning? This is what Social Cognitivism attempts to address.
                    Social Cognitivism is a branch of <a href="./cognitivism.html">Cognitivism</a> based on the fact that our changes in mental processes occur through observing others, 
                    practising skills that taught by others, and then getting feedback about our performance from others 
                    (Schunk, 1989). In essence, when we pay attention to people's actions, we can better remember them and thus store this
                    information in long-term memory (Lecture 5). Learning in Social Cognitivism is often defined by our <a href="../../experience.html">experiences</a>,
                    including other people we encounter or inspire us as well as our <a href="../../experience/culture.html">cultural context</a>. Other 
                    composers, whether they are teachers or some of the great composers of the past, teach us methods of composition that we can learn from
                    (details <a href="../../experience/social/social.html">here</a>).  Not getting any feedback on your compositions might
                    not allow you to learn as much because you don't get advice on what you can focus your attention on next time you try to compose, 
                    so learning becomes a lot harder without this outside perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good feedback on a piece reinforces the composer's <a href="../../challenges/talent.html">self-efficacy</a> and therefore, will be more likely to compose 
                    more pieces in the future. This interaction between the learner, their environment, and a learner's behaviour can be visualized as follows (Lecture 5):
                </p>

                <img class="piano-imgs" src="../../imgs/social_triangle.png">

                <p>
                    Social cognitivism is unique because it places the focus on the learner AND the people that interact 
                    with the learner, as opposed to just what goes on inside the learner's mind, like in <a href="../cognitivism.html">Cognitivism</a> (Lecture 5).
                    The emphasis on the learner also means that it is the learner that has control over what they chose to learn, unlike 
                    <a href="../behavourism.html">behaviourism</a> which would claim that we need to rely on punishments, rewards, or external stimuli
                    to learn, which will often be something that is controlled externally. When learners have control over what and <i>how</i> they learn, they 
                    will be a lot more <a href="../../motivation/motivation.html">motivated</a> to engage in the learning process.
