        <h1>What is learning?</h1>
            <p>
                Learning is change (lecture 2). Different learning theories have different opinions on what kind of change occurs 
                during learning. For instance, <a href="./home/behavourism.html">behaviourists</a> claim that learning 
                is a visible change in behaviour, while <a href="./home/cognitivism.html">cognitivists</a> would say that
                learning is a change in your mental processes. On the other hand, <a href="./home/social_cognitivism.html">
                social cognitivists</a> would argue that learning is a change of interactions with others and the environment. 
                <a href="./home/constructivism.html">Constructivists</a> would say that one learns by constructing their own knowledge. Finally, 
                <a href="./home/humanism.html">humanists</a> claim that learning is all about becoming the best version of yourself. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In my experience composing, I can track my learning and improvement in my compositions by comparing the complexity of
                my previous works with my current ones. This can be complexity in terms of how detailed the melody or accompaniement 
                are, what kinds of effects I am able to create, the complexity of the rhythms, etc. Below is a snippet of a piano melody 
                I came up with in high school. It is quite simple since the accompaniment is exactly the same throughout all the measures,
                and there aren't any tonality or dynamic contrasts.
            </p>

            </audio>

            <p>
                In comparison, this is a part of a piece I wrote two years ago. The accompaniment is much more complex since, there is
                some kind of upwards progression in the first notes of each slurred group of triplets, as well as 3 against 2 polyrhythm 
                (eighth notes vs triplets). I have also learnt the importance of articulations, dynamic and expression markings which help
                me convey emotions more effectively. In this sense, it shows that throughout many years, I have learnt different aspects
                of composing that are essential to conveying my ideas to creating expressive music.

            <p>
                By paying <a href="attention.html">attention</a> to techniques from some <a href="experience/expertise.html">
                composers</a>, I was able to gain more knowledge about tricks and strategies I can use to convey my ideas. The examples shown
                above are like a <a href="../home/behavourism.html">display of behaviour</a> that attest to the fact that I have indeed
                learned how to be a better composer. ***make the sonnection to learning from people + that link to attn***
