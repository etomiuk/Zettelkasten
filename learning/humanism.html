        <h1>Learning Theories</h1>
            <h2>Humanism: composition as a way to fulfill your potential</h2>
                <p>
                    The humanist view of learning claims that the point of learning is to become better versions of ourselves 
                    (Lecture 7). In this view, learning should always be centered about fulfilling our potential and goals 
                    (link to goals here). This is described in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where the top of this pyramid is
                    self-actualization. Maslow's pyramid implies that we should strive to attain self-actualization, which is 
                    being able to master something that matters to us.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Link to composition: do composers try to become better versions of themselves through composition? Relate to mastery goal (link)
                </p>

                <p>*** maybe put this in why learn to compose section instead?</p>
