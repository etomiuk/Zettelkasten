            <h1>Constructivism: creating new knowledge through music</h1>
                <p>
                    According to constructivists, learning happens by making your own meaning from your experiences (Ertmer & Newby, 2013).
                    Instead of gaining knowledge from outside sources, like in <a href="./cognitivism/social_cognitivism.html">social cognitivism</a>, 
                    the learner is the one who creates the knowledge based on what they already know. In a way, by creating new ways of combining sounds and melodies, 
                    composers create new knowledge, new ways of expressing a certain idea that others can use and modify to create their 
                    own unique interpretation. In this sense, a novice composer can learn to compose in a constructivist way sort of through trial and error, 
                    where they create new ways of writing music and giving a set of notes a certain meaning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, this construction of knowledge would 
                    be very difficult to do for someone with zero background in music: how can you constrct knowledge if you have nothing to base yourself on? This is 
                    why Ertmer & Newby (2013) suggest that a constructivist approach to learning might be beneficiel for later stages of learning, once you have 
                    already acquired the prerequisite knowledge about the topic you are learning which you can use as a basis to solve more complex problems.  
                    This type of learning can benefit from discovery learning, in which students are encouraged to generate knowledge themselves rather 
                    than having an instructor directly lecture on the material to learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because composition is a creative art, I think that this learning theory makes sense. Although I have never take a composition course, 
                    I think that it would be strange if composition was taught in the same way, say, a psychology course was taught, because every 
                    composer will have their own style and way of expressing their musical ideas, and the goal of learning to compose should not be 
                    to memorize a set of rules that you need to use in your compositions. Everyone will be creating their own knowledge in this sense, 
                    so you have to discover which ways work the best for you. This discovery learning is what can allow one to be <a href="../motivation/creativity.html">
                    creative</a> with their work. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, this knowledge that is constructed does not have to be done in isolation. Social constructivism is a branch of 
                    constructivism that emphasizes the role of group knowledge and that other individuals' ideas, perspectives, and thoughts all
                    play a role in the formation of knowledge (Lecture 6). Just like <a href="./cognitivism/social_cognitivism.html">social cognitivism</a>, 
                    other individuals play an essential role in our learning.
