        <h1>How do we learn to compose?</h1>
            <h2>Cognitivism: changing mental processes when composing</h2>
                <p>
                    The cognitivist view about learning claims that we learn through changes that occur to our mental processes (Lecture 4).
                    Some of these mental processes include attention, memory, knowledge processing, and organization. This makes sense: in order
                    for us to learn a new composition technique, we must first pay attention to how this technique is used in music. If we don't 
                    pay attention to what we learn, the information is unable to enter our sensory register to then move on to our working memory,
                    meaning that we will never be able to process the information, work with it and store in in memory later on. Several factors 
                    influence how we pay attention to the things we learn. For instance, if we are <a href="../motivation/motivation.html">motivated</a>
                    and interested in the things we learn, this alllows us to direct our attention towards learning these things. In the 
                    context of composition, we can pay attention to the way that certain composers write music and how their music sounds so that we can 
                    learn and <a href="../experience/social/modelling.html">imitate</a> kinds of music that we enjoy. Even though cognitivists don't necessarily
                    factor in the <a href="../experience/social/social.html">role other individuals</a> in our learning, directing attention towards other people's actions is a great first step to 
                    storing composition-related information in memory, which is what <a href="../learning/cognitivism/social_cognitivism.html">social cognitivists</a>
                    would claim to be the key to learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once information is able to enter the sensory register, it moves on to working memory, which is where the information is worked with (Lecture 4).
                    Information can move into our long-term memory so that we can retrieve this information later on. This tranfer of information
                    to long-term memory is easier when make make the effort to connect old information to new information that was just encoded. Thus, a cognitivist
                    would strongly encourage this sort of deep processing as an effective way to learn. A good way to do this would be to transfer your knowledge from 
                    another skill you know to the current skill you are learning, such as composition. If you're an artist, you can approach composition as if you'd 
                    approach a painting: starting off with a rough sketch of the main ideas, then creating an accompaniment (like the background of the painting), then little
                    by little embellishing the melody with harmony, articulations, dynamic details, just like you'd add the finishing touches on a painting.
