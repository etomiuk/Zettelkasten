        <h2>Long-Term Memory</h2>
            <p>The final stage in the duel-processing model is long-term memory, where important information form working memory goes and stays for longer periods of time. For information to get to long-term 
                memory, we need to conect it with information that is already there (Lecture 4). 
            </p>
            <p>Composers have many techniques to make their music memorable. 
            MUMT250: melodies are recognized by intervals more than scale degree, 
            melodic contour is an important feature --> that's what we tend to recognize
            
            </p>
            <p>Even though rote memorization and mindless repetition will not necessarily make information stick in long-term memory, Ormrod (2017) claims that constantly reviewing can help
                keep information that is already encoded in long-term memory stay there longer, especially if the information is reworked and connected with other information. One advantage of this repetition
                is that automaticity (Ormrod, 2017). Composers might repeat a theme or melody often in a piece, but maybe in slightly different ways (to make it interesting - see <a href=attention.html>ways of capturing attention</a>).
                We automatically know what the theme of the first movement Beethoven's 5th Symphony is, and one reason might be because it is constantly repeated throughout the entire piece, just slightly different each time.
            </p>
            <p>This automaticity might be advantageous because it makes us faster at executing a task (Ormrod, 2017). When I first started composing, I had to learn how my music notation software worked. I had some musical ideas, but it took
                a long time for me to figure out how to write it properly in musical notation because I was unfamiliar with how the software worked. Now, after I have practiced a lot, a lot of my music writing has become automatic, 
                which leaves me more room on my limited working memory to focus on my ideas.
            </p>
