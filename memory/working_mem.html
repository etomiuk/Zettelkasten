        <h2>Working Memory</h2>
            <p>Working memory is the next component of the dual-store model of memory. This is where the information that successfully passed the sensory registers goes and is worked with.
                Similar to the sensory register, it has time limits (~30 sec), as well as capacity limits (Lecture 4). 
            </p>
            <p>The primacy and recency effect explain why we remember certain types of information. The primacy effect says that we remember information that is presented first because it's 
                the first thing we pay attention to and we have more time to process it, while the recency effect says that we remember the last thing that is presented to us because it is what
                is freshest on our minds. For this reason, I think that a good composition needs a good introduction and conclusion. That way, the introction captures a listener's 
                attention right away, and the conclusion will also be one of the last things they will remember of a piece. 
            </p>
            <p>Ormod (2017) talked about maintenance rehearsal as a way to keep information from slipping away from working memory. Personally, I find it difficult
                to come up with original ideas for a new piece. Unfortunately, musical ideas always seem to come to me at the worst times: when I'm walking my dog, when I'm trying to study 
                for a midterm, in my dreams, etc. It's important for me to remember these ideas before I lose them. When an idea comes, I constantly sing it to myself until I can go a write it down somewhere, either
                on paper or in my music notation software. However, my melody ideas that are shorter are generally easier to remember because working memory has a limited capacity.
            </p>
            <p>Composers often "hear" their music they compose in their head. This is called auditory imagery (Ormrod, 2017). Perhaps combining the visual music notation with the auditory hearing
                of the melody would lead to composers (and listeners) remembering their melodies better?
            </p>
