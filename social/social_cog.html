        <h2>Social Cognitive Theory</h2>
            <p>This theory aligns with the fact that learning is very social. It proposes that much of our learning happens through obersation of others, practising, 
                and then getting feedback about our performance from others (Schunk, 20xx). As mentioned <a href="index.html#experience">here</a>, learning is often defined
                by experiences, including other pepole we encounter or inspire us. Schunk (20xx) mentions that we tend to replicate behaviour from people who are more similar to
                us because then it is more likely that we obtain the same outcome as them.
            </p>
            <p>Different cultures have different music, so it seems natural that composers from different cultures have different composing styles, and that future people coming 
                from similar cultures adopt similar styles as well. It even goes as far as different cultures have different scale modes. Because I was born in Canada, and my ancestry 
                is European, I am very much more likely to adopt Western composition techniques and methods. I use common Western tonal scales for instance. Perhaps if I had had an Asian 
                background, I would have been more influenced by Asian composers and modes in my pieces. Although it is extremely common to borrow interesting aspects of different cultures
                to make a piece interesting or to make it express a certain story (example: Borodin Steppes of Central Asia has an Oriental theme even though he's Russian).
