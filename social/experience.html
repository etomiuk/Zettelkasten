            <p>Learning is also a very social. Learning often involves someone teaching you something, whether it is a physical teacher
                like in school, or an online teacher from a Youtube video, or from a book that teaches you something (Lecture 2). Learning to compose
                is also a very social thing. One rarely writes music for themselves - they write it for someone to play or 
                listen to it. A great quote from Victor Hugo expresses how music can teach you things that cannot be learnt in any other way:
            </p>
            <h4>"Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent" - Victor Hugo (ClassicFM)</h4>

            <p>One can learn to compose with a composition teacher, either at school or by finding a private teacher. I have personally seeked help
                from my previous orchestra conductor who is a famous Canadian composer, as well as my high school band teacher. My band teacher is especially
                helpful when I write band music because she is able to tell me if my pieces are playable on all the band instruments, as well as gives
                me ideas when I am stuck.
                
                Nowadays, there are many online 
                communities of composers (like in Facebook groups) that are there to give advice on others' compositions and that can help inspire 
                aspiring composers. Ertmer & Newby (2013) realized that recently, much of our learning occurs through conversation because knowledge
                and other people are much more accessible through the Internet.
