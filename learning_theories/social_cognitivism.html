        <h1>Learning Theories</h1>
        <h2>Social Cognitivism</h2>
            <p>
                This theory is based on the fact that learning is very social. It proposes that much of our learning happens through obersation of others, practising, 
                and then getting feedback about our performance from others (Schunk, 20xx). Learning is often defined
                by experiences, including other people we encounter or inspire us. Schunk (20xx) mentions that we tend to replicate behaviour from people who are more similar to
                us because then it is more likely that we obtain the same outcome as them. The people we copy might be our <a href="../social/modelling.html">models</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social Cognitivism can be seen as a branch of <a href="./cognitivism.html">cognitivism</a> because it involves many changes in our mental processes. We need to pay <a href="../attention.html">attention</a>
                to our environment and what we learn from it, and this information learned from the environment will be eventually stored in <a href="../memory/ltm.html">long-term memory</a>. 
                However, social cognitivism is unique because it places the focus on the learner AND the people that interact with the learner, as opposed to just what goes on inside the 
                learner's mind. The emphasis on the learner differentiates this theory from <a href="./behavourism.html">behaviourism</a> since a behaviourist would claim that the learner 
                would not really have control over what they learn - it is only through rewards or punishments from other people that one would learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social cognitivists can visualize learning through the interactions between a person, the environment, and behaviour. The person is considered a social agent
                who uses their cognitive processes and social circles to make decisions and learn. They might be influenced by reinforcements and punishments in the environment which
                causes them to react and act in the world. (I know this is not a great explanation of the triangle we saw in class). This constant interaction between these three variables
                is seen in composing: good feedback on a piece reinforces the composer's <a href="../social/self_efficacy.html">self-efficacy</a> and therefore, will be more likely to compose 
                more pieces in the future. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning depends on the experiences we live (Lecture 2). One's style of composition
                is often influenced by an experience, another inspiring composer, or the music we listen to. Style might also be influenced
                by your <a href="../social/modelling.html">teacher</a>.
                One can learn patterns or textures in music by listening and analyzing pieces they enjoy. Although I like
                to experiment, my personal style is probably similar to the late-romantic era of classical music.
                I am inspired and learn from composers such as Dvorak, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and I try to create large dramatic
                effects using a large orchestra. I learn how to capture emotions or a story through music by seeing how these composer do it. I also
                tend to follow similar structures of music that were popular in that time. For instance, many composers wrote Scherzo's in a specific form: 
                start with a theme, then a secondary theme (usually repeated twice), return to the main theme (these form section A), then a completely new section usually called "trio" (section B),
                then repeat section A all over again with an optional coda or conclusion (Wikipedia). I have used the exact same structure when writing Scherzo-like pieces as well.
